<p>As I write this, more than half the States in the U.S.A. are refusing Syrian refugees.  However, Pennsylvania has accepted about 120 refugees this year (according to a report from Pittsburgh's Action News) and will continue to accept them, as long as Governor Wolf has his way.  Here is part of an official statement he released on Monday 11/16, "Governor Wolf wants Pennsylvania to continue to build on its rich history of accepting immigrants and refugees from around the world but he is also committed to protecting Pennsylvanians and will work with the Federal Government to ensure it is taking every precaution necessary in screening those families coming into the country.”</p>
<p>The problem is that these precautions have already failed in Minnesota.  The Obama administration assured us that the Somali refugees entering Minnesota were not terrorists.  It was later discovered that some of these refugees were recruiting for ISIS.  I covered this in a recent post.  To read it, go <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/10/26/un-plan-for-refugees-exposes-u-s-to-terrorists/">here.</a>  If you research this for yourself you will see that in <!--more-->Minneapolis they are dealing with a host of problems related to these refugees, including community surveillance, by our federal government and the expenses involved in bringing  so many people to a land where the needy are taken care of for"free", by the taxpayers.</p>
<p>We don't want these problems in Pennsylvania.  I called the governor's office today, to voice my opinion.  ( <a href="tel:717-787-2500" target="_blank">717-787-2500</a>, )  I also signed this petition yesterday. (<a href="https://www.change.org/p/governor-tom-wolf-refuse-refugees?recruiter=10170067&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=share_facebook_responsive&amp;utm_term=des-lg-share_petition-custom_msg">click here</a>)  I believe over 60,000 Pennsylvanians have signed the petition.  I hope you will sign the petition and call the governor.  This will take about 2 minutes of your time.  Another few minutes could be spent posting this on face book and emailing to friends.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this policy is not just coming down from the Obama Administration and being supported by Governor Wolf.  This is a United Nations edict.  The UN High Commissioner For Refugees (UNHCR) tells UN member countries, including the United States, how many refugees each nation must accept.  In my <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/10/26/un-plan-for-refugees-exposes-u-s-to-terrorists/">previous post </a> the following background information was given:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"The UNHCR’s leader happens to be Antonio Guterres, a political figure from Portugal who is the former President of the Socialist International (SI). The little-known SI has long proclaimed its “ultimate objective” to be “nothing less than world government,” boldly adding that “membership in the United Nations must be made universal.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guterres is joined in the further entangling of the United States in UN projects by UNICEF leader Anthony Lake, a State Department veteran whose commitment to the UN and world government is no secret. These two are even working with officials from Communist China and other veterans of the SI."</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>PA State Representative Lynda Culver has suggested calling the governor's office (717-787-2500) and contacting our federal representatives in Congress. You  can contact congress <a href="http://www.jbs.org/federal-legislative-action-alerts?vvsrc=%2fcampaigns%2f42999%2frespond">here.</a></p>
<p>Ultimately, we need to get out of the UN altogether.  Please support the American Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2015. (<a href="http://www.jbs.org/federal-legislative-action-alerts?vvsrc=%2fcampaigns%2f30420%2frespond">click here</a>) This legislation will revoke U.S. membership in the UN.  This is a necessary step in passing on the American Way of Life to future generations.</p>
