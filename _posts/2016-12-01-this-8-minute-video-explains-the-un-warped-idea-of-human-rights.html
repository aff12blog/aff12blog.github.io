<p>As Alex Newman explains in t<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/north-america/item/24734-un-human-rights-council-a-dictator-s-paradise">his TNA video,</a> it's time for us to #Amexit the UN.  The UN dictator's club, which calls itself the "Human Rights Council" is a disgrace. Our American idea of liberty is based on God-given rights being protected by government.  The UN idea is that rights can be dispensed and taken away by the UN.  In this scenario the UN takes the place of God.  <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/north-america/item/24734-un-human-rights-council-a-dictator-s-paradise">Click here </a>to watch this video, by The New American magazine.</p>
<p>HR 1205 The American Sovereignty Restoration Act will get us out of the UN.  <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2016/10/16/petition-congress-to-pass-the-american-sovereignty-restoration-act/">Click here</a> to find out more.</p>
