<p>I suggest you <a href="http://www.jbs.org/mobile/jbs-news/featured-news/item/18137-justice-scalia-opposed-a-constitutional-convention/18137-justice-scalia-opposed-a-constitutional-convention" target="_blank"><strong>read</strong> <strong>this</strong></a> to understand Justice Scalia's true position on a Constitutional Convention. Former US senator, Tom Coburn, and other Con-Con supporters would have you believe that Scalia supported a Con-Con. This exposes the lie and gives you the pertinent details.</p>
