<blockquote><p>America, you are beautiful...and blessed...The ultimate test of your greatness is the way you treat every human being, but especially the weakest and most defenseless. If you want equal justice for all and true freedom and lasting peace, then, America, defend life. ~ St. John Paul II</p></blockquote>
