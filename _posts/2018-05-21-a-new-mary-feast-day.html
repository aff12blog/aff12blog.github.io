<p>Pope Francis has declared a new Marian feast day. The feast of "the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church" will be celebrated on the Monday after Pentecost each year.</p>
<p>The decree states:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Indeed, the Mother standing beneath the cross (see John 19:25), accepted her Son’s testament of love and welcomed all people in the person of the beloved disciple as sons and daughters to be reborn unto life eternal. She thus became the tender Mother of the Church which Christ begot on the cross handing on the Spirit. Christ, in turn, in the beloved disciple, chose all disciples as ministers of his love toward his Mother, entrusting her to them so that they might welcome her with filial affection.<br />
As a caring guide to the emerging Church Mary had already begun her mission in the Upper Room, praying with the Apostles while awaiting the coming of the Holy Spirit (see Acts 1:14). In this sense, in the course of the centuries, Christian piety has honored Mary with various titles, in many ways equivalent, such as Mother of Disciples, of the Faithful, of Believers, of all those who are reborn in Christ; and also as “Mother of the Church” as is used in the texts of spiritual authors as well as in the magisterium of popes Benedict XIV and Leo XIII.</p>
<p>And since May is the month of Mary we will be starting a family Marian Consecration using the new book by Dr. Carrie Gress:  <em><strong>"</strong><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marian-Consecration-Children-Carrie-Gress/dp/1505111188/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526944949&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=marian+consecration+for+kids">Marian Consecration for Children</a>"</strong></em>. You can read more about the book <a href="http://www.carriegress.com/books/"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a>.  Dave and I have done the St Louis de Montfort: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/True-Devotion-Mary-Preparation-Consecration/dp/0895551543/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526944984&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=louis+de+montfort"><em><strong>"True Devotion to Mary: with Preparation for Total Consecration"</strong></em></a> and Fr. Michael E. Gaitley's: "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Days-Morning-Glory-Do-Yourself/dp/1596142448/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526945012&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=33+days+to+morning+glory+book"><em><strong>33 Days to Morning Glory: A Do-It-Yourself Retreat In Preparation for Marian Consecration</strong></em></a>" but I have been wanting to find a Marian Consecration to do with the kids and Dr. Gress's book is perfect! Typically, you begin the Consecration so that it ends on a Marian feast but I was so excited about the new feast day and this new book that I decided to start today. And <a href="http://www.looktohimandberadiant.com/2018/05/mary-mother-of-church-new-feast.html"><em><strong>here's</strong></em></a> a great craft you can do to celebrate this new feast day!</p>
