<p>Many feel that the <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/11/13/full-text-of-the-tpp-now-available-only-5554-pages/">Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) </a>is doomed, since President-elect Trump is against it.  While it appears obvious that the TPP is dead, it would be prudent to recall that NAFTA appeared dead in the few weeks and months before it was passed by Congress.  Those who opposed NAFTA will recall that, Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich fought tooth and nail to get the votes to pass NAFTA even as it appeared to be dead.  To refresh your mind about how NAFTA passed read this<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/trade/stories/tr111893.htm"> article by Washington Post reporter Kenneth J. Cooper.</a></p>
<p>If we are not careful, we will be reading similar stories about the TPP.  Mr. Obama is committed to the TPP.  He is as determined to pass it as Bill Clinton was to pass NAFTA, 23 years ago.  The lame-duck session is a perfect time for Obama and company to make deals with politicians, many of whom will not be accountable to the voters, to pass the TPP.</p>
<p>Before we declare the TPP dead, let's contact Congress every week until the lame-duck session is over.  A quick and easy way to do that is to <a href="http://www.jbs.org/federal-legislative-action-alerts">click here.</a>  Once you're done send the link to as many people as possible.  Ask them to<a href="http://www.jbs.org/federal-legislative-action-alerts"> use the link to contact Congress </a>in opposition to the TPP, every week until the lame-duck session is over.</p>
<p>Once Mr. Trump takes office, if he is true to his word, then the TPP will be dead and we can worry about getting rid of NAFTA.</p>
