<li>It does NOT pertain to Jesus' conception in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary.</li>
<li>It <strong>IS</strong> the <em><strong>conception of the Virgin Mary in the womb of her mother, St. Anne</strong></em>, wherein she (Mary) was preserved exempt from all stain of original sin by God's grace in view of the merits of Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>The Immaculate Conception was defined by Pius IX in 1854. According to this <a href="https://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2bvm23.htm" target="_blank"><strong>dogmatic definition</strong></a>, it has been revealed by God that Mary was preserved from original sin from the moment of her conception.</li>

<blockquote><p><strong><em>The Blessed Virgin Mary in the first instance of her conception, by a singular privilege and grace granted by God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race, was preserved exempt from all stain of original sin.  ~ Pius IX Ineffabilis Deus</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<li>Mary appeared to St. Catherine Laboure on November 27, 1830 and gave her the vision for what would become known as the Miraculous Medal. The vision showed our Lady standing on a globe with her arms outstretched and with dazzling rays of light streaming from her fingers. Framing the figure was an inscription: <em><strong>O Mary conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee.</strong></em></li>
<li>In 1846, <a href="https://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/LANDMARY.HTM"><strong>Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception was declared the Patroness of the United States</strong></a>.</li>
