<blockquote><p>Actions speak louder than words; let your words teach and your actions speak.  ~ St. Anthony of Padua</p></blockquote>
<p>St. Anthony was born in Lisbon, Portugal, near the end of the 12th century. He was a Franciscan Friar and was sent to work among the Muslims of Morocco. Crowds would gather to hear his preaching and teaching. He was chosen by St. Francis to teach theology to the friars and he later converted many heretics from the <em><strong><a href="http://www.catholic.com/tracts/the-great-heresies">Albigensian heresy</a></strong></em>.  <!--more-->Some pictures show St. Anthony holding a bible. This is because he knew, loved and preached the Word of God so well. St. Anthony was so well educated especially in Sacred Scripture that Pope Pius XII proclaimed him the "Evangelical Doctor," or Doctor of Sacred Scripture. Many statues of St. Anthony show him with Baby Jesus because Baby Jesus appeared to him. He also had quite a reputation as a miracle worker. His shrine is a place of pilgrimage and many miracles are attributed to him.</p>
<p>I think most people are familiar with St. Anthony as he is the patron of lost articles. Whenever I couldn't find something my mom would tell me to say a prayer to St. Anthony...we've probably all done that at one time or another!</p>
