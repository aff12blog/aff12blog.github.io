<p>I just read a report from Reuters titled <span style="text-decoration: underline;">White House may have to renegotiate pacific trade pact:  senator.</span>  In this report Senator Hatch admits that the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) doesn't have enough support in Congress and may need to be renegotiated.  He  mentions that the idea of passing this in a lame-duck session is unpopular and talks about some of the ways the deal could hurt businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>What Senator Hatch did not say is that the TPP is not only bad for the economy but will compromise our independence.  As we have stated in<a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/10/13/the-tpp-must-be-opposed/"> recent posts. </a> I strongly urge everyone to <a href="http://www.jbs.org/federal-legislative-action-alerts">keep the pressure on Congress.</a></p>
