<blockquote><strong>"As the family goes, so goes the nation and so goes the whole world in which we live." (John Paul II)</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Truer words were never spoken.  I also agree with these words from Dr. Scott Hahn, "<em><strong>If</strong></em> <em><strong>Catholics simply lived the grace of the sacrament of marriage, in forty years we would be a Christian society."</strong></em></p>
<p>At the Festival of Families, Pope Francis said, in part:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>"Thank you to those who have given their testimonies. Thank you to those who have brought us joy with their art, with beauty, which is the path to reach God. Beauty brings us to God. And a true testimony brings us to God, because <strong>God also is the truth,</strong> He is beauty, He is goodness, and a testimony given to serve is good, it makes us good people, because God is good. It brings us to God. All that is good, all that is true, all that is beautiful brings us to God. Because God is good, God is beautiful, <strong>God is the truth. </strong></p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who gave us a message here and [thank you] for the presence of all of you, which is also a testimony, a true testimony that it is worthwhile to live as a family, that <strong>a society grows strong, grows in goodness, grows in beauty and truly grows if it is built on the foundation of the family."</strong> (emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="http://amzn.to/1Ln3as9">Communist Manifesto</a>, Marx calls for "The abolition of the family".  He also writes,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all states of society. But <em>Communism abolishes eternal truths,</em> i<em>t abolishes all religion,</em> <em>and all morality</em>, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.” (emphasis added)</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I am attempting to reiterate the importance of the family.  However, my more important purpose is to illustrate that those who espouse Marxist political and economic ideas are supporting the abolition of: the family, eternal truths such as freedom and justice, all religion, and all morality.  Whenever someone says healthcare, education, etc. should be provided free of charge by government,  they are supporting the philosophy of Marx.  Remember that nothing is free.  When government taxes "the rich" to provide these "free" programs, it steals from those trying to support their family.  Often times they are the same people who would be providing jobs and stimulating the economy, by running businesses or investing in them.</p>
<p>Marxist philosophy and it's attack on the family, have made great headway in our nation under the guise of liberalism and tolerance.  The Communist Manifesto was published in 1848.  In the the wake of it's publication, Communist/Socialist revolutions sprang up, throughout Europe.  This revolutionary activity spilled over into the United States and was documented by Michael J. Schaack, in <a href="http://amzn.to/1FJIx7k">Anarchy and Anarchists</a> (1889)<a href="https://homicide.northwestern.edu/pubs/anarchy/">. </a> I would like to close by reflecting on the words of Pope Leo XIII, in his encyclical <em><strong><a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_20061888_libertas.html">Libertas, </a></strong></em>from 1888;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"35. And as to <i>tolerance</i>, it is surprising how far removed from the equity and prudence of the Church are those who profess what is called liberalism. For, in allowing that boundless license of which We have spoken, they exceed all limits, and end at last by making no apparent distinction between truth and error, honesty and dishonesty. And because the Church, the pillar and ground of truth, and the unerring teacher of morals, is forced utterly to reprobate and condemn tolerance of such an abandoned and criminal character, they calumniate her as being wanting in patience and gentleness, and thus fail to see that, in so doing, they impute to her as a fault what is in reality a matter for commendation. But, in spite of all this show of tolerance, it very often happens that, while they profess themselves ready to lavish liberty on all in the greatest profusion, they are utterly intolerant toward the Catholic Church, by refusing to allow her the liberty of being herself free."</strong></p></blockquote>
