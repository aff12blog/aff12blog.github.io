Bless us now and in death's agony.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The month of February is dedicated to the Holy Family. I recently read that it is good practice to memorize short prayers to recite throughout the day, to keep our thoughts focused on our life as Christians.<!--more--> The short invocation above is appropriate especially at night before we go to bed and during this month that the Church has dedicated to the Holy Family.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">February 1st is St. Brigid Day. St. Brigid is also known as "Mary of the Gael" and is the patroness of Ireland. She is the founder of the first Irish monastery in Kildare. She was born in Dundalk in 450 AD and created the unique cross that bears her name and is normally made from rushes. The distinctive design is thought to keep evil, fire and hunger from the homes where it is displayed. The tale of its creation is as follows: There was an old pagan Chieftain who was dying and his servants summoned Brigid to his bedside hoping that she could calm his restless spirit. She is said to have sat by his bed, consoling and calming him, and then she picked up some rushes from the floor and began weaving them into the distinctive cross pattern. While she weaved, she explained the meaning of the cross to the sick Chieftain and it is thought that her calming words brought peace to his soul and he requested to be baptized as a Christian just before his passing. Since that day it has been customary to fashion a St. Brigid Cross and place it inside the house over the door. <em>Catholic Icing</em> has instructions to make a St. Brigid Cross out of pipe cleaners.
