<p>You may want to review my previous posts on this issue.  They are <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2016/01/20/protect-our-constitution/">Protect our Constitution</a>, <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2016/02/10/a-crash-course-on-a-constitutional-convention-in-less-than-7-minutes/">A Crash Course on a Constitutional Convention (in less than 7 minutes)</a>, and<a href="http://aff12blog.com/2016/03/09/the-convention-of-states-deception/"> The Convention of States Deception.</a></p>
<p>If 34 States call for an Article V Convention, then Congress must call a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments, and our Constitution will be susceptible to major changes.  There are many con-con calls proposing to solve problems for liberals and conservatives alike.  The excuse which has the most traction is the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA).  Never mind that it won't balance the budget.  Forget that if you force <!--more-->Congress to submit a balanced budget, without cutting programs, you are asking for more taxes and deficits.  Apparently many feel we need a con-con for this amendment.</p>
<p>In 2016, both West Virginia and Oklahoma have applied for a BBA con-con.  The good news is that on May 3, Delaware rescinded all of it's con-con calls.  At this time there are 28 States with live applications for a BBA con-con.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has a BBA con-con call from 1979, that is still considered live.  There are also several resolutions being considered by our State Legislature, which would call for an Article V Convention for various "reasons".  We need to rescind our live calls and stop these new calls from being passed.  If you want more information and/or to take some useful action, please <a href="http://defendit.tk/">click here.</a>  Their is an action tab you can click to send messages to State officials.  You can also use the messages as talking points, when calling your State Representative's office.</p>
<p>If we do nothing, PA may become one of 34 States which call for an Article V Convention.  Our founders marveled at the propitious circumstances by which they were able to give us our Constitution.  Those circumstances do not exist today.  Many who desire a convention say an Article V Convention is not a Constitutional Convention, so don't worry about changes that could destroy our liberty.  Black's Law Dictionary, the definitive legal lexicon in American law, defines the term constitutional convention, then refers to an Article V convention as an example of one: "Constitutional convention. A duly constituted assembly of delegates or representatives of the people of a state or nation for the purpose of framing, revising, or amending its constitution. Art. V of U.S. Const. provides that a Constitutional Convention may be called on application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the states".</p>
<p>Our founders spent their fortunes and blood for our liberty.  I think our liberty and that of future generations is worth a few emails and phone calls.</p>
