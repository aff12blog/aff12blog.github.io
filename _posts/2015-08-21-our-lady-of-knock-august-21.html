<p>Our Lady of Knock – August 21</p>
<p>I love Marian feasts!!! And there are so many to celebrate. Today we celebrate Our Lady of Knock, an approved apparition of Our Lady in the little village of Knock, Ireland. And we will celebrate by having Irish Soda bread for dessert (recipe below)!</p>

<p>On the evening of August 21, 1879, Mary McLoughlin, a priest’s housekeeper, and thirteen others saw the moving figures of the Blessed Virgin Mother, St. Joseph, and St. John the Evangelist along the south wall of the local church. St. John was standing near an altar with a young lamb upon it, holding a book, and preaching. The onlookers could not hear anything and there was no vocal message, they witnessed this miracle for about one hour. Many were skeptical about the vision but soon after a little girl was cured of her deafness when her mother touched the child’s ears with a piece of concrete from where the Virgin Mother appeared.</p>

<p>There is a great devotion to this Lady in Ireland as well as around the world. She is considered <em>Our Lady of Silence </em>since during these apparitions at Knock she spoke no message and no warning; she asked for nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">            <strong>THE HAIL MARY IN GAELIC</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“Sé do bheath' a Mhuire, atá lán de ghrásta, tá an Tiarna leat. <br />Is beannaithe thú idir mná agus is beannaithe toradh do bhruinne losa. <br />   A Naomh Mhuire, a mháthair Dé, guí orainn na peacaithe, anois is ar uair ar mbás.” Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Prayer to Our Lady of Knock</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Our Lady of Knock, Queen of Ireland, you gave hope to our people in a time of distress and comforted them in sorrow. You have inspired countless pilgrims to pray with confidence to your divine Son, remembering His promise: “Ask and you shall receive, Seek and you shall find.” Help me to remember that we are all pilgrims on the road to heaven. Fill me with love and concern for my brothers and sisters in Christ, especially those who live with me. Comfort me when I am sick or lonely or depressed. Teach me how to take part ever more reverently in the holy Mass. Pray for me now, and at the hour of my death. Amen.</p>
