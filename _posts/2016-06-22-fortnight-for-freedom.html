<p>Every year dioceses around the country plan special events to highlight the importance of defending religious freedom. The Fortnight for Freedom is from June 21—the vigil of the Feasts of St. John Fisher and St. Thomas More—to July 4, Independence Day. You can read more about it at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) <a href="http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/religious-liberty/fortnight-for-freedom/"><em><strong>website</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>The bishops have urged an intensification of penance and prayer for religious freedom in our country.  Resources are provided <a href="http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/religious-liberty/prayer-resources.cfm"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a> to help the faithful learn more about our courageous forebears in the faith and to follow their example. The bishops recommend praying to Mary Immaculate Patroness of Our Country. You can find the prayer <a href="http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/religious-liberty/upload/Immaculate-Conception-English.pdf"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>The USCCB is also sponsoring an American tour of the relics of Saints Thomas More and John Fisher.<strong>  </strong>The relics will be coming to Philadelphia on June 25. You can see the schedule <a href="http://phillycatholiclife.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Fortnight-for-Freedom.pdf"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a>. An excellent family night could include watching the movie <em>A Man for All Seasons</em>, about the martyrdom of St. Thomas More. An another good movie would be <em>For Greater Glory</em>, about the struggle for religious freedom in Mexico.</p>
