<p>Most Americans realize that the replacement for deceased Justice Scalia will be an important Supreme Court appointment.  What many do not realize is, that this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Bob Adelmann has recently reported the following, in the New American Magazine;</p>
<blockquote><p>"But the opportunity to reshape the judicial environment in the United States extends far beyond filling the Scalia vacancy. <a href="http://www.readingeagle.com/ap/article/trump-to-inherit-more-than-100-court-vacancies-plans-to-reshape-judiciary" target="_blank">There are 104 current vacancies</a> (including Scalia’s) all across the federal bench, with 38 of them termed “judicial emergencies” — where a court’s backlog of cases exceeds 600, or where the vacancy has lasted longer than 18 months. Thirteen of those 104 are on federal appeals courts, 82 are in U.S. district courts, and the remainder are in courts of special jurisdiction (i.e., the U.S. Court of Federal Claims)."</p></blockquote>
<p>Adelmann goes on to explain the impact that Obama had on our federal courts.  He writes, in part, "...<strong>when Obama took office there was only one openly gay or lesbian judge on the bench. He appointed 11 more. In addition, only one of the 13 regional circuit courts had a majority of Democratic-nominated judges, but today nine do."</strong><!--more--></p>
<p>Mr. Adelmann also puts perspective on the lower federal courts, as compared to the Supreme Court.  He writes,<strong> "Since the Supreme Court handles an average of 75 cases a year, most of Trump’s impact will be felt at the lower levels where tens of thousands of cases are adjudicated every year. And while the Supreme Court focuses on the Constitution, the lower courts have the opportunity to set the legal tone on everything from state gun laws to abortion to immigration to voting rights."</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Trump will be opposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein and other liberals/Socialists, who want the federal courts to continue working against our Republic.  We will need to stay in touch with our government officals, to ensure that good American judges are appointed.</p>
<p>I strongly urge you to read this brief article in TNA,</p>
