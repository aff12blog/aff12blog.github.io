<p>Happy Labor Day! Well, it's the last day of summer vacation and I am a little sad. So, I decided I wanted to start a new tradition...it's something I've always wanted to do and I finally got around to doing it this year!</p>
<p>I made the (little) kids Schultuetes!</p>

<p>The tradition of the Schultuete or "school cone" dates back to 1810 and is one of the most celebrated and long-standing traditions in Germany. At the beginning of every school year, children all over Germany set off to their first day of school with their Schultuete filled with little gifts, school supplies and sweets.</p>
<p>They loved them! Now we are ready to start the new school year!  :)</p>
