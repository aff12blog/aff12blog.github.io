<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: right;">Monsignor Krysztof Charamsa, for 12 years, has been a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which is tasked with promoting and defending Church doctrine.  Now on the eve of the Synod on the family he has chosen to apply pressure on the Pope to change Church doctrine.  CNN reported it this way;  "With his partner at his side, Monsignor Krysztof Olaf Charamsa held a news conference Saturday in Rome, calling on Pope Francis to revise Catholic doctrine on homosexuality, which considers same-sex relationships sinful."</p>
<p>Do you think he became a priest intending to serve Christ?  It seems more likely that he had an agenda in becoming a priest, then sought a position with the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith to push the changes he desired. Perhaps, after twelve years of attempting to change Church doctrine,  he has decided he might be more effective in "coming out" publicly to put pressure on the Synod.  CNN quoted Charamsa this way; "<!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">"<strong>My decision of 'coming out' is a very personal decision in the homophobic world of the Catholic Church. It has been very difficult and very hard. I ask that you keep in mind this reality that is difficult to understand for anyone who has not lived through an identical passage in their own life," Charamsa told reporters.</strong></p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong>"The timing is not intended to pressurize anyone, but maybe a good pressure, in fact a Christian participation, a Christian voice that wants to bring to the synod the response of the homosexual believers to the questioning of Pope Francis."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">In a <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/10/01/some-reflections-in-the-wake-of-the-world-meeting-of-families/">previous post</a> we quoted the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0717802418?keywords=communist%20manifesto&amp;qid=1444228220&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Communist Manifesto</a>, <em>“<strong>There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience.”</strong></em></p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">Those who follow Marx seek to destroy The Church.  Years ago I read a book that dealt with this topic,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aa-1025-Memoirs-Communists-infiltration-Church/dp/0895554496"> </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aa-1025-Memoirs-Communists-infiltration-Church/dp/0895554496/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1444228264&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=AA--1025+THE+MEMOIRS+OF+AN+ANTI-APOSTLE.%28+Marie+Carre%29" target="_blank">AA--1025 THE MEMOIRS OF AN ANTI-APOSTLE</a> (Marie Carre)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aa-1025-Memoirs-Communists-infiltration-Church/dp/0895554496">.</a>  It was a quick read but it detailed the life of someone, who became a Catholic priest, as a communist agent, trying to destroy the Church from within.  This plan was exposed by the confession of Bella Dodd.  She was a leader of the Communist Party U.S.A.(CPUSA).  Dodd testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph"><strong><em>"In the 1930's we put eleven hundred men into the priesthood in order to destroy the Church from within."</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">I don't know anything about Charamsa.  I just think his actions are indicative of an agent, attacking the Church from within.  He certainly must have been aware of the Church teaching on homosexuality, before becoming a priest.  Is it possible that he was unaware of his oath of celibacy?</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">Those who have been shocked by so many priests abusing children should consider this;  Is it likely that men who chose to devote themselves to Christ, then became abusers?  Or is it more likely that many of the agents, attacking the Church from within, are also sexual perverts?</p>
<p class="zn-body__paragraph">Anyone who aids in attacking the Church needs our prayers.  Their souls are in real danger.  As for the Church, the gates of hell shall not prevail, against it.</p>
