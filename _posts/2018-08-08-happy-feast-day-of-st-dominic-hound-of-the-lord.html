<p>St. Dominic was a Spanish saint who lived from 1170-1221. I didn't know much about him but when my grandson was born on his feast day, August 8th and named 'Dominic' I wanted to learn more about him. He was known for many things but I am going to touch on a few that stuck out for me.</p>
<p><a href="http://aff12blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/st-dominic-with-hound.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1308 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/st-dominic-with-hound-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>First, how he became known as the "Hound of the Lord". Many pictures of St. Dominic portray him with a dog with a torch in his mouth. <!--more-->Now this intrigued me because 3 years ago we rescued a St. Bernard pup, Max, and any Catholic stuff that includes dogs makes me think of my Max. The story goes that when Dominic's mother was pregnant with him she had a dream that a pup leapt from her womb carrying a torch in his mouth as if to set the world on fire. The dog became a symbol for the order that Dominic founded, the Order of Preachers (Dominicans). In Latin they were known as <em>Dominicanus. </em>Other friars started calling them <em>Domini canis</em> or "dogs of the Lord". So the Dominicans would go on to say that they were "watchdogs for the Lord."</p>
<p>Second, how our Lady gave Saint Dominic the Rosary as a weapon to combat the awful Albigensian heresy. Albigensian doctrine was based on a dualism of two opposing principles, good and evil, all matter being regarded as evil and the creator of the material world as the devil. Therefore, the doctrine of the Incarnation was denied. Albigensians were destroying the minds of the Catholic laity with its erroneous ideas. The Albigensians’ teachings encouraged suicide, many times by self-induced starvation, because they believed that the body was an intrinsic evil and that the soul must be liberated from matter at all costs.</p>
<p>In 1214, while he was laboring without success to convert souls back to the one true faith, Our Lady appeared to him and gave him a powerful weapon, the Angelic Salutation, that is the Angel Gabriel’s greeting to the Virgin Mary at the Incarnation, and the pattern in which it should be prayed. She also gave the rosary “mysteries” which reflected on the Incarnation, Passion, and death of her Son. The words of the Angelic Salutation combined with meditations on the divine mysteries was to be used as a prayer and catechism tool to teach the people the true Christian faith.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Wonder not that you have obtained so little fruit by your labors, you have spent them on barren soil, not yet watered with the dew of Divine grace. When God willed to renew the face of the earth, He began by sending down on it the fertilizing rain of the Angelic Salutation. Therefore preach my Psalter composed of 150 Angelic Salutations and 15 Our Fathers, and you will obtain an abundant harvest.”</p>
<p>~ Blessed Virgin to St. Dominic</p>

<p>And there are a couple of interesting legends associated with St. Dominic:</p>
<ul>
<li>At his Baptism, his mother, Blessed Joan of Aza, saw a star shining from his chest. This became a symbol used in art pertaining to St. Dominic and led him to be declared the patron saint of astronomy.<a href="http://aff12blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dominic-star.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1305 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/dominic-star.png" alt="" width="183" height="276" /></a></li>
<li>Legend says that Dominic received a vision of a beggar who would do great things for the faith. Dominic met the beggar the next day. He embraced him and said, "You are my companion and must walk with me. If we hold together, no earthly power can withstand us." The beggar was Saint Francis of Assisi.</li>
