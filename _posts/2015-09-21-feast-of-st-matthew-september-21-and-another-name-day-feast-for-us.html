<p>Today we celebrate the feast of St. Matthew. St. Matthew was a tax collector in the city of Capernaum. As you can imagine, most tax collectors were hated by the Jews because they worked for the Romans. One day, Jesus saw Matthew and he said, “Follow me.” At once, Matthew left his money and his position to follow Jesus. Matthew was one of the twelve apostles and is the author of the first Gospel.</p>

<!--more-->Saint Matthew tells us that our Lord commanded: “Do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will worry about itself.” (Matthew 6:34) This is something I try to do each day. We can get so caught up in worrying about the future that we forget to live for today.</p>
<p>Today we will celebrate our Matt’s Name Day. He will get to use the special <a href="http://amzn.to/1L1qHPf" target="_blank">'Red Plate'</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=amerfamioff09-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> at dinner. After dinner we will share some chocolate ‘gold’ coins. And read <a href="http://amzn.to/1V6G9c6" target="_blank">The Parables of Jesus</a> (The Pharisee and the Publican) by Tomie dePaola.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Prayer to St. Matthew</strong><br />
<em>God of mercy, You chose a tax collector, St. Matthew, to share the dignity of the apostles. By his example and prayers, help us to follow Christ and remain faithful in Your service. We ask this through Our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, Who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
