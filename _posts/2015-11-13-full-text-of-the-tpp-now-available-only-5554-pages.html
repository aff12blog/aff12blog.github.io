<p>I suppose, like Obama Care, " We have to pass it to find out what's in it."</p>
<p>Sen. Jeff Sessions has read enough to say this,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"This agreement is not just about promoting trade; it is about creating a framework for a transnational union which supersedes the authority of Congress."  </strong><em>(On November 10, 2015, on the floor of the U.S. Senate)                                                                                                 </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Sessions explains some specific concerns,<!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>"This global governance authority is open-ended: 'The Commission and any subsidiary body established under this Agreement may establish rules of procedures for the conduct of its work.' It covers everything from the movement of foreign nationals: 'No Party shall adopt or maintain ... measures that impose limitations on the total number of natural persons that may be employed in a particular service sector ... in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test'; to climate regulation: 'The Parties acknowledge that transition to a low emissions economy requires collective action.'</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems if we allow our Government to sign on to the TPP we agree to no limits on the number of people allowed to enter our nation, provided they claim they're here for work.  We also agree to controls on our economy to counter climate change.  This sounds like UN Agenda 21.</p>
<p>I already found one link to the UN, in Chapter 28 of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).  Here is some of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Chapter 28 Dispute Settlement:</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Article 28.21: Private Rights</strong></p>
<p><strong>No Party may provide for a right of action under its domestic law</strong> against any other Party on the ground that a measure of the other Party is inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement, or that the other Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations under this Agreement. (emphasis added)</p>
<p><strong>Article 28.22: Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Each Party shall, to the maximum extent possible, encourage and facilitate the use of arbitration and other means of alternative dispute resolution for the settlement of international commercial disputes between private parties in the free trade area.</li>
<li>To this end, each Party shall provide appropriate procedures to ensure observance of agreements to arbitrate and for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in such disputes.</li>
<li><strong>A Party shall be deemed to be in compliance with paragraph 2 if it is a party to and is in compliance with the 1958<em>United Nations Convention on the Recognition and</em></strong> <strong>Enforcement<em> of Foreign Arbitral Awards</em>.  </strong>(emphasis added)                                                                                                                                                                                                         You can see how just a brief look at the TPP shows a loss of sovereignty.  What is in the rest of the 5,554 pages?    Let's not allow our elected officials to pass it and find out.   Let's put the pressure on to oppose the TPP.  (<a href="http://www.jbs.org/federal-legislative-action-alerts?vvsrc=%2fCampaigns%2f43314%2fRespond%3fvvcgUT%3dR-u-Ruvi8tKEw8fwLRsD8w%26vvcgRD%3dBb6243GUf7yfqyE%26vvsbr%3dJGQBPl_jiUjdAscXmtzP-A">click here</a>)                                  We also need to get out of the UN.  Please support The American Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2015.  (<a href="http://www.jbs.org/federal-legislative-action-alerts">here)</a></li>
