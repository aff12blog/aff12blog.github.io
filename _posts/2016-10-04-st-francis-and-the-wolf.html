<p>Today is the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. He was known for his great love of animals. You can read all about the legend of St. Francis and the Wolf of GubbioÂ <a href="http://tamingthewolf.com/saint-francis-and-the-wolf/"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>I've posted before about our new Saint Bernard pup, Max. He is our first dog and quite a handful. But we've come to love him as part of our family. Our parish had a 'blessing of the animals' this past Saturday in honor of the Feast of St. Francis of Assisi. So, we took Max and Rex, our bunny (you can't see Rex but Joey is carrying him in the blue pet carrier...I think Rex was a little petrified!). Max was very excited to see all his dog 'friends' so it was difficult to get him to sit still for a pic as he was more interested in socializing with EVERY dog there.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Max's 1st birthday was September 18 so we got him a bunch of treats and this really nice St. Francis of Assisi medal for his collar.</p>
