<p>On Monday October 5, 2015, U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Froman, announced that the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations have finally reached an agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).   I strongly urge you to read the post entitled, "<a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/09/15/tpp-ttip-and-tisa-what-would-washington-say/#more-183">TPP, TTIP, and TiSA... What would Washington Say?"</a>  I agree with Senator Jeff Sessions, that the TPP  will lead us into  economic then political union with Asia and the Pacific Rim  nations, just as the European Union is a political Union that grew out of economic union.  These trade unions will erode our independence, just as George Washington warned.  I hope you will watch the <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=blEd8fwVR3w">seven minute video</a> with Senator Sessions.  I strongly urge you to <a href="http://www.jbs.org/federal-legislative-action-alerts">oppose the TPP </a>by contacting the proper government officials.  The TPP has to be approved by Congress before we are committed to it.  For more information go <a href="http://www.jbs.org/issues-pages/stop-the-free-trade-agenda">here.</a>  I received an <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/jbs/1503a02bec15a955">email alert from the JBS </a>about this, that may also be of interest.  It exposes some of the secrecy in the wording of this agreement.  For all the talk of  <em>transparency</em> this administration is being very secretive about these trade partnerships.</p>
