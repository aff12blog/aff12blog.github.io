<p>Today is the Feast of St. Padre Pio. My plan was to keep this post brief and just post an inspirational quote of his. But when I was trying to find the perfect quote I couldn’t decide which one to post as there were so many thought provoking quotes made by this exceptional saint. So…I decided to post a few…or several. Which one is your favorite?</p>
<blockquote><p>Pray, hope, and don’t worry. Worry is useless. God is merciful and will hear your prayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It would be easier for the world to survive without the sun than to do without Holy Mass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It is difficult to become a saint. Difficult but not impossible.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t allow any sadness to dwell in your soul, for sadness prevents the Holy Spirit from acting freely.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>My past, O Lord, to Your mercy; my present, to Your love; my future to Your providence.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>You don’t have to be worthy; you only have to be willing.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Divine Goodness not only does not reject repentant souls, but even goes in search of obstinate ones.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>You need to hold fast to two virtues: kindness toward your neighbor and humility toward God.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Bear in mind that the more the enemy assaults you, the closer God is to your soul. Think about that and penetrate this great and comforting truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Let us always keep before our eyes the fact that here on earth we are on a battlefield and that in paradise we shall receive the crown of victory; that this is a testing ground and the prize will be awarded up above; that we are now in a land of exile while our true homeland is Heaven to which we must continually aspire.</p></blockquote>
