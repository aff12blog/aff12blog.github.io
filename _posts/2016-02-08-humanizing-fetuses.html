<p>One of the many new commercials, during the Super Bowl, was a <em><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko7GuDOv4BM" target="_blank">Doritos commercial</a></strong></em> that was accused of "humanizing" fetuses.  The pro-death people on social media didn't like the fact that an ultrasound showed the baby, in its mother's womb, reacting to the movement of a nacho chip.</p>
<p>News flash!  Fetuses<strong> are</strong> human!<strong>  </strong>Not only is it common-sense that human beings will have human off-spring, but for those of us who believe the bible is God's word, it is clear that every person is important to God, even prior to conception.  Recall God's words to the prophet, in the first chapter of Jeremiah, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you".  Modern ultrasound technology makes dehumanizing fetuses impossible.  That is why the pro-death abortion crowd doesn't like women to see ultrasounds, especially of their own fetuses.  In a recent article on lifesitenews.com, titled<a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/10-surprising-quotes-from-abortionists" target="_blank"> <em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">10 shocking confessions</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from abortionists</span></strong></em>,</a> the first item is very much to the point:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>1. They [the women] are never allowed to look at the ultrasound because we knew that if they so much as heard the heart beat, they wouldn’t want to have an abortion. –<strong>Dr. Randall, former abortionist</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It's clear that we need many more expectant mothers to see the ultra sound of their child. People, in general, would benefit from the "humanizing" effect of seeing the fetuses, via ultrasound, as their hearts beat and they move and live prior to birth.  I'm not sure how so many humans have allowed themselves to be fooled, into believing that fetuses in the mother's womb are not human.  Those with a vested interest in abortion know the power of an ultrasound.  I hope we can find more ways to use this technology to promote life.</p>
<p>As we educate others about the truth of <em><strong>human</strong> </em>life in the womb, there is another truth we need to share.  Namely, Roe V Wade is <strong>not truly </strong>"the law of the land".  Every State in the Union has the power to make their own laws opposing abortion, without federal interference.  Why is this so?  Two facts are pertinent:  1.  <em><strong><a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">Article I, Section 1 of the U. S. Constitution </a></strong></em>states, "All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,..." This means that only Congress has law-making power. <strong> Supreme court decisions are not law.</strong>  2.  The U. S. Constitution is a compact between the States.  It is the instrument used by the States, to delegate certain specifically enumerated powers to our federal government.  According to the tenth amendment in the<a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html#text"><em><strong> Bill of Rights</strong></em>, </a>"<em><strong>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."  </strong></em>The federal government has no authority in the Constitution, the XIV Amendment, or any amendment to the Constitution, to force the States to accept abortion as "the law of the land".  The truth that must be shared is that each and every<br />
State in the Union can and should make abortion illegal.  If all the people who recently marched for life would educate their state officials and fellow citizens on this issue, abortion would soon be illegal and this dark period of our American history would end.</p>
