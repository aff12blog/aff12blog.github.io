<p style="text-align: left;">My younger kids have standardized testing this week at school and they are convinced that eating/sucking on Jolly Ranchers helps them to perform better. So, last night we made Jolly Rancher cross lollipops for them to take to school and share with their classmates. <!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://aff12blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/jolly-rancher-crosses-2.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-809"><img class="size-medium wp-image-809 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jolly-rancher-crosses-2-300x300.jpg" alt="jolly rancher crosses 2" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are very simple to make and the best part is you can eat all the 'broken' Jolly Ranchers while you are sorting out the 'good' ones to use for the lollipops. I found the recipe (with pictures) <em><strong><a href="http://www.catholicicing.com/make-your-own-candy-cross-pops/" target="_blank">here</a> </strong></em>at the Catholic Icing blog.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here's a simplified version:</p>
<p><strong>JOLLY RANCHER CROSS LOLLIPOPS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jolly Ranchers</li>
<li>lollipop sticks</li>
<li>Aluminum Foil</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 225 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Unwrap your jolly ranchers, and cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil, shiny side up.</li>
<li>The jolly rancher in the middle of your cross needs a little extra oven time, so place just your middle jolly rancher on the cookie sheet and place in the oven <em>on the center rack</em>for 1-2 minutes. (Allow room on the foil to build the rest of your cross and also for your stick.)</li>
<li>Remove the tray from the oven (don’t burn yourself) and arrange the rest of the jolly ranchers around the middle one in a cross shape. Place them as closely together as possible.</li>
<li>Place the tray back in the oven, and heat for about 5-7 minutes, or until the jolly ranchers melt together.</li>
<li>Take the tray out of the oven, immediately place the stick on the cross and roll until the candy surrounds the stick.</li>
<li>Allow the candy to cool and harden, then lift off the foil.</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align: left;">Today is also Spy Wednesday, the day that Judas betrayed Jesus to the Sanhedrin for 30 pieces of silver. As I mentioned in my previous post we hide 30 quarters for the kids to find. However, when I broke into my husband's coin jar today he didn't have 30 quarters. So I had to improvise...I decided to use 10 quarters, 10 dimes, and 10 nickels.</p>
