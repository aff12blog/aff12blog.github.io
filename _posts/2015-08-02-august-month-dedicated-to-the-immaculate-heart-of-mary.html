<p>Dave and I have been talking about starting a blog for quite some time and we are finally doing it! So, it is fitting that we would begin in August which is dedicated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. I just love Marian devotions! Since becoming a mother 25 years ago I can really relate to Mary…and the older I get the more I strive to be like her. Which is easier said than done, so…I just keep praying! And this year, August begins on Saturday so for my first “Catholic” blog entry I decided to write about devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the First Saturday devotion.</p>
<p> Pope Pius XII stated: “Consecration to the Mother of God is a total gift of self, for the whole of life and for all eternity; and a gift which is not a mere formality or sentimentality, but effectual, comprising the full intensity of the Christian life – Marian life.” This consecration, the Pope explained, “tends essentially to union with Jesus, under the guidance of Mary.”<!--more--></p>
<p> In 1917, when Mary appeared at Fatima, she asked for the whole world to be consecrated to her Immaculate Heart. <em>"Jesus wishes you to make me known and loved on earth. He wishes also for you to establish devotion in the world to my Immaculate Heart."</em> (June 13, 1917)</p>
<p>The conditions contained in Our Lady’s request include: reception of Holy Communion and Confession (within 8 days before or after). Pray five decades of the Rosary. Spend 15 minutes in meditation on the mysteries of the Rosary. (All these are to be offered up in reparation for sins and ingratitude against the Immaculate Heart of Our Lady.)</p>
<p>Why Five Saturdays? Our Blessed Lord answered that question when He appeared to Sr. Lucia on May 29, 1930. He explained that it was because of five kinds of offenses and blasphemies against the Immaculate Heart of Mary, namely: blasphemies against her Immaculate Conception, against her perpetual virginity, against the divine and spiritual maternity of Mary, blasphemies involving the rejection and dishonoring of her images, and the neglect of implanting in the hearts of children a knowledge and love of this Immaculate Mother.</p>
<p>Now I am going to go off on a little tangent. I would assume that everyone is aware of what is going on with Planned Parenthood…the videos of Planned Parenthood officials, doctors and directors negotiating the sale of aborted baby parts. You can clearly hear during the videos the methods used to avoid ‘crushing’ organs, how to extract hearts and livers intact, and laughter over the hope to buy a Lamborghini. It’s truly repulsive. So, will America finally wake up? How can anyone turn their heads on this and pretend it’s not happening? That it’s just a clump of tissue when clearly they are speaking about organs that babies have…not clumps of tissue! Congress is voting this Monday, 8/3 on whether or not to defund Planned Parenthood. IF Congress does the right thing and defunds Planned Parenthood it would be a big step in the fight for pro-life. It will not stop abortions from happening (it won’t overturn Roe vs. Wade) but it WILL change the momentum of the pro-life initiative and alert Congress that we’ve had enough.</p>
<p><strong>There are a couple of things we can all do…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sign the petition</strong> asking your Senators to defund Planned Parenthood. Here’s the link: <a href="http://capwiz.com/nrlc/issues/alert/?alertid=67417626"><u>http://capwiz.com/nrlc/issues/alert/?alertid=67417626</u></a></p>
<p> And <strong>PRAY</strong>! Storm heaven with prayers (especially rosaries) offered for the reparation of sinners, for those involved in the abortion industry and for those suffering following abortion. Prayer can change hearts.</p>
<p> <strong>Immaculate Heart of Mary</strong>, pray for us.</p>
<p><strong>St. Michael the Archangel</strong>, pray for us.</p>
