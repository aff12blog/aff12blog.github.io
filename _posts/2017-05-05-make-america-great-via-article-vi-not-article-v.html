<p>There are many who feel that we can solve America's problems with an Article V Convention.  I recently attended a lecture, by Constitutional Scholar Robert Brown, in which he asserts that Article VI is the solution.  He insisted that an Article V Convention is not only dangerous, at this time, but is also not intended to address the problems we currently face.  Brown points out that Justice Scalia saw danger in an Article V Convention:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AjBEsWs6Xo"><em><strong>"A constitutional convention is a horrible idea.  This is not a good century to write a constitution."</strong> </em> - Justice Antonin Scalia  May 11, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Brown uses the<em> Federalist Papers </em>and quotes from our founders to expose the lie that Article V is the intended remedy for our current problems.  If our problems stemmed from errors or deficiencies in the Constitution then Article V would be the correct remedy.  However, our problems stem from lack of adherence to the Constitution.  This is where Article VI comes in.  It states in part,<!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; "</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Article VI further states,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution;"</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>All federal and state officials are required to uphold and defend our Constitution and only laws which are "made in Pursuance thereof".  Mr. Brown points out that our federal officials are ignoring the Constitution and making laws which violate it, while the state officials too often co-operate with these unconstitutional federal edicts.  A strict adherence to our Constitution, especially Article VI, would shrink our government to about 20% of its current size and cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Brown is so persuasive that he was able to convince Montana State Rep. Brad Tshida to oppose his own bill to call for an Article V Convention.  Rep. Tshida, who introduced HJ8, voted against the measure and explained why he thought his colleagues should as well.  HJ8 was soundly defeated.  You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UX16qVnXQk">click here </a>to hear Rep. Brad Tshida and Robert Brown address the Montana State Legislature on this issue.</p>
<p>Mr.  Brown's speech is called Change It or Obey It?  - Why the Constitution is the Solution.  If you want to see a 5 minute introduction, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQSoFUjBt4E">click here.</a></p>
<p>I hope you'll view the introduction and want to watch the whole speech.</p>
