<p style="text-align: center;">“O name of Mary! Joy in the heart, honey in the mouth, melody to the ear of Her devout clients!” ~ St. Anthony of Padua</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://aff12blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/holy-name-of-mary.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-194" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/holy-name-of-mary.jpg" alt="holy name of mary" width="195" height="258" /></a></p>
<p>Today we celebrate the Holy Name of Mary. Eight days after the birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in accordance with Jewish law, her parents, Saints Joachim and Anne, were inspired by their visions of angels to name her “Mary”.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“There is not such powerful help in any name, nor is there any other name given to men, after that of Jesus, from which so much salvation is poured forth upon men as from the name of Mary…that the devout invocation of this sweet and holy name leads to the acquisition of superabundant graces in this life, and a very high degree of glory in the next”.  ~ Richard of St. Laurence</p>
<p>Last year I read about the ‘red plate’ tradition--when someone deserved special praise or attention they were served dinner on ‘The Red Plate’. In our family on your birthday you choose your birthday dinner. I thought serving your birthday dinner on The Red Plate would be a nice addition to our original tradition. So, I ordered The Red Plate from Waechtersbach, “the original red plate company”.</p>

<p>Then, I recently read about another tradition…”Name Day” celebrations. Back in the day it was customary for a child to be given a Christian name or the name of a Saint. And the reason you did this was so that the child would have a patron, a protector, and someone to model themselves after. A Name Day is the Feast Day of a Saint for whom one is named. So, I decided that we would also use The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Waechtersbach-Plate-Special-Today-Cherry/dp/B0001XR2F2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1442876637&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=red+plate" target="_blank">Red Plate</a> to celebrate our Name Days. So, today, on this Feast of the Most Holy Name of Mary we will also celebrate our Mary’s Name Day and she will get to use The Red Plate at dinner tonight!</p>
