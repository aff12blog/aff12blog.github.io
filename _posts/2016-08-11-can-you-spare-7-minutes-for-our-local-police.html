<p>Our family prays for our police every night but prayer is not enough.  St. Augustine taught that we should pray as though everything depends on God but work like it all depends on us.  We must pray for our police and, at the same time, support our local police to keep them independent of federal control.  Please take 7 minutes to watch this video, The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Truth About Obama's Push to Nationalize Police. </span> To view it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-Ki7LzQzt0">click here.</a><!--more--></p>
<p>On Friday August 5th members of the John Birch Society sponsored a Support Your Local Police information booth a the Hatboro Night Out.  Many copies of  the <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA3118.pdf">"Police Under Fire" issue of The New American magazine </a>were handed out to police and citizens supporting their local police.  Pamphlets and DVDs on this topic were distributed, as well as,  pocket copies of the U.S. Constitution.  The Support Your Local Police and Keep them Independent message was well received!</p>
<p>If you want to better understand the attack on our local police and what can be done about it,  <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA3118.pdf">click here,</a> to read this issue of The New American magazine.</p>

<p>Please continue to pray and work to Support Our Local Police and Keep Them Independent.  A great way to start is by using the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-Ki7LzQzt0">7 minute video, </a>the <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA3118.pdf">pdf of The New American magazine, </a> and  linked blog posts to inform yourself and others.</p>
