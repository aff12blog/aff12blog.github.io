<h1 class="quoteText">“[the CFR has as a goal] submergence of U.S. sovereignty and national independence into an all-powerful one-world government.… this lust to surrender the sovereignty and independence of the United States is pervasive throughout most of the membership.… In the entire CFR lexicon, there is no term of revulsion carrying a meaning so deep as ‘America First’</h1>

<p><span class="QuoteReference">(<a class="QuoteAuthor" href="http://www.ourrepubliconline.com/Author/105">Admiral Chester Ward</a>, <i>Kissinger on the Couch</i>, pp. 144-150. 1975.)</span></p>
<p>Admiral Chester Ward made the statement quoted above, after having been a Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member for many years.  It should help to shed light on the attacks faced by Mr. Trump due to his "America First" stance.</p>
<p>When President Trump was campaigning for office he referred to the "Deep State" trying to destroy his America First agenda.  Trump has warned us of "the swamp" and a "cabal" seeking "global government".<!--more--></p>
<p>Many Americans have come to believe that government policy is manipulated by shadowy forces in military intelligence and in government.  They think of this as the "swamp" or "Deep State".  In fact an ABC News/Washington Post poll from April 2017, shows that about half of Americans now believe in the existence of this "Deep State".</p>
<p>What is the "Deep State"?  Who are the powerful men who make up the "cabal", referred to by Mr. Trump?  What can be done about it?  These are important questions for those Americans who want liberty for themselves and future generations.</p>
<p>I suggest that the best way to begin to answer these questions is to click the link below and read this special issue of The New American magazine.  I hope you will not only find it informative put will share it with others, to inform them on this important topic.</p>
