<p>In a September 29, 2015 speech at United Nations headquarters in New York City, Attorney General Loretta Lynch unveiled the plan called the <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/crime/item/21702-guns-ammo-targeted-n-y-atlanta-cede-law-enforcement-policy-to-european-think-tank">Strong Cities Network. </a> Under the guise of protecting us from terrorism, we will lose our local police forces to the federal leviathan and further lose our sovereignty to the "UN Global Community"</p>
<p>We urge you to investigate this and oppose the Strong Cities Network.  For more information click <a href="http://www.jbs.org/mobile/jbs-news/featured-news/item/18217-stop-the-strong-cities-network-plan-for-globally-controlled-police">here.</a></p>
