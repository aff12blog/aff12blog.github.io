<p>Our Constitution is in danger of being revised or completely destroyed!  The very real danger is an Article V convention.  If 34 States call for a convention, then according to Article V of the U.S. Constitution, Congress must call a convention.  The Constitution makes no provision for limiting the convention.  It would have the same power as the 1787 Convention, which was supposed to revise The Articles of Confederation, but instead gave us the greatest Constitution ever written.</p>
<p>My concern is that today's liberal/socialist politicians will tinker with our beloved Constitution in convention and liberty, for future generations, will be compromised.  There is not one problem we face today, which can be blamed on our Constitution.  In fact, for most of our problems, the Constitution is the solution.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has an existing call for a convention, supposedly to balance the budget.  The budget can only be balanced by strict adherence to the Constitution.  If we continue to spend our tax dollars, funding unconstitutional programs, then the only way to "balance" the budget is with increased taxes and deficits.  If we pressure Congress to spend only in accordance with the Constitution, the size and cost of our government will be reduced 80%.</p>
<p>I hope you will contact your State Representatives and Senators.  Urge them to rescind any PA calls for a convention and oppose any new calls.  Also please educate yourself on this issue by going <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/22314-save-the-constitution-by-rescinding-article-v-convention-applications">here.</a></p>
