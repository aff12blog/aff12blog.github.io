<p>October is the month dedicated to the Most Holy Rosary. Rosary means a <em>crown of roses</em>, it's like a spiritual bouquet given to our Blessed Mother. So many saints and popes have spoken on the power and importance of praying the rosary. Here are some of my favorite quotes:<!--more--></p>
<p>"There is no surer means of calling down God's blessings upon the family . . . than the daily recitation of the Rosary" (Pope Pius XII).</p>
<p>"The Rosary is a magnificent and universal prayer for the needs of the Church, the nations and the entire world" (Pope John XXIII).</p>
<p>"How beautiful is the family that recites the Rosary every evening" (Pope John Paul II).</p>
<p>“Never will anyone who says his Rosary every day be led astray. This is a statement that I would gladly sign with my blood”  (Saint Louis de Montfort).</p>
<p>“One day, through the Rosary and the Scapular, Our Lady will save the world”  (Saint Dominic)</p>
<p>“The Rosary is THE weapon”  (Saint Pio of Pietrelcina--Padre Pio)</p>
<p>“Continue to pray the Rosary every day”  (Our Lady of Fatima to Sister Lucia)</p>
<p>Need I say more? PRAY THE ROSARY!!!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Today is also the Feast of St. Therese of Lisieux, the Little Flower. I recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Story-Soul-Autobiography-Therese-Lisieux/dp/0935216588/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443709879&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=st+therese+story+of+a+soul">The Story of a Soul</a> which is the autobiography of St. Therese.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">St. Therese believed that "obedience, prayer and sacrifice" were her duty. As a child she used a small string of beads (<a href="http://thelittleways.com/how-to-make-sacrifice-beads">Sacrifice Beads</a>) in her pocket to help her count the good deeds she did to offer to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have my own set of 'sacrifice beads' that Anna made me at Rosary Makers at school. (I also use them to say a decade of the rosary).</p>
