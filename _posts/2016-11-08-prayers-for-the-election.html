<p>Today is election day! Tough times call for tough measures! Prayer is needed! I was looking for some quick, powerful intercessions and came up with the following:</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="https://www.ewtn.com/library/PRAYER/PRAGNOV.TXT">Infant of Prague (Nine Hour) novena</a> - </strong></em>this 'crash' novena is said at the same time every hour for nine consecutive hours during just one day. So, if you start now you will finish before the polls close!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/Memorare.htm"><em><strong>Saint Mother Teresa of Calcutta novena</strong></em></a> - this 'express' novena is easy - simply recite the <a href="https://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/Memorare.htm"><em><strong>Memorare</strong></em></a> 9 times.</p>
<p><a href="http://kofc.org/un/en/resources/news/national-novena.pdf#utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=pdf-prayer&amp;utm_campaign=vote-2016"><em><strong>Prayer to Mary, the Immaculate Conception Patroness of the United States</strong></em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">By Your Holy and Immaculate Conception, O Mary, Deliver Us From Evil.  ~ <em><strong><a href="http://www.ourladyofamerica.com/">Our Lady of America</a></strong></em></p>
