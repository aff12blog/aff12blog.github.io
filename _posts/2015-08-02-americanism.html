<p>Many people say they are patriotic. They love freedom. They go to a parade on Independence Day or possibly a fireworks display. Maybe they vote or even spend time supporting candidates at election time.</p>
<p>Americanism is much more. It is a philosophy of liberty and a method, given us by our founders, to secure liberty for ourselves and future generations.<!--more--></p>
<p>Americanism is embodied in the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence asserts, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness…That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed…“</p>
<p>This means; there are eternal truths, some of which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a God who created us.</li>
<li>He gave us our rights.</li>
<li>Men created government to secure these unalienable rights.</li>
<li>Governments derive their powers from the people.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the foundation of Americanism.</p>
