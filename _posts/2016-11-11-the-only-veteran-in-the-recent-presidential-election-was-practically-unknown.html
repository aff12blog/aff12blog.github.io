<p>Darrell Castle is a former U.S. Marine and undoubtedly the best candidate for president in the recent election.  You say you never heard of him?  That makes sense.  The establishment-controlled media didn't mention him.  I suggest you learn about him and decide for yourself if he would have been a good president.  <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/24027-interview-constitution-party-presidential-candidate-darrell-castle">Click here to read an interview with Darrell Castle, in The New American Magazine.</a></p>
<p>I urge you to <a href="http://castle2016.com/platform/">click here for a look at Castle's Campaign Platform.</a></p>
<p>Now ask yourself why you never heard of a presidential candidate who is a pro-life ex-marine and believes in God and the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>We need to find better sources of information.  We also need to insist that our Political Party of choice gives us the best candidates possible.</p>
