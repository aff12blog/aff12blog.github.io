<p>Happy Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross! On this day we recall three historical events: the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena (mother of the emperor Constantine), the dedication of churches built by Constantine on the site of the Holy Sepulchre and Mount Calvary, and the restoration of the True Cross to Jerusalem by the emperor Heraclius II. Ultimately, this feast celebrates the Holy Cross as the instrument of our salvation.</p>
<p>Have some cross shaped treats (cookies, rice krispy treats, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/284219426458249992/"><em><strong>cake</strong></em></a>) or make/buy a batch of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crCweQUUX90"><em><strong>cupcakes</strong></em></a> and arrange them in the shape of a cross today to celebrate. Get some fresh basil...read more about this tradition in my previous post <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/09/13/feast-of-the-exaltation-of-the-holy-cross-september-14/"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a>.</p>
