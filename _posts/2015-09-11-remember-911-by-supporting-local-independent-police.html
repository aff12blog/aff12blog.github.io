<p>Following the 9/11 tragedy, local police, firemen, and all "first responders" were seen as heroes.  However, today local police are not respected and supported, in their communities, as they should be.  The events in Ferguson, Missouri are a key, to this lack of respect and <!--more-->support.  When you see supposed spontaneous groups of protesters, in Ferguson and other communities, you should look closely at the signs they hold.  Pre-printed signs indicate organization.  In this case the signs actually had a website for the Socialist International printed, at the bottom.  Much of the funding for these groups of "spontaneous" protesters came from George Soros.  In fact the Washington Times published an article entitled <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/14/george-soros-funds-ferguson-protests-hopes-to-spur/?page=all">"George Soros funds Ferguson protests, hopes to spur civil action"</a>, in which reporter Kelly Riddell documents not only the Soros funding but how these groups worked on social media, to create a media buzz.</p>
<p>The demonstrations and lack of respect for the police are reminiscent  of the riots and attacks on the police, in the 1960's.  In 1966, Cleon Skousen's book  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Communist Attack on U. S. Police</span> explained how professional agitators could move mobs of protesters against the local police.  Skousen references testimony, by CIA agent Lyman B. Kirkpatrick, Jr., before the Senate Internal Security Committee in 1961.  Kirkpatrick explains that Soviet agents used an instructional manual, which directed them to get allies in the media to repeat lies about the local police, so that the community would begin to believe they could not trust their local police.  If these communists/socialists have their way, people will believe their local police are incompetent, corrupt, brutal, and simply can't be trusted.  Kirkpatrick also testified that, <strong><em>"Another method to paralyze police action has been to get Communists or fellow travelers into political office.  This is done in such a way that the individuals involved are not known as Communists but as members of some legitimate political party. These individuals go to work to either 'rule or ruin' the police services in that area."</em></strong></p>
<p>Why would Socialists and Communists want to attack local police?  The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the NAZI's (ie. German National Socialists) both had nationalized police forces.  The USSR had the KGB and the NAZI's had the Gestapo. A national police force is necessary to keep order in a slave state.  A national police force is their goal here, in the U.S. George Seldes authored a book, called <em>Truth Behind the News </em>(1928).  Seldes explains the purpose, of the Soviet Cheka (national police force founded in 1918):  Freedom, Liberty, Justice as we know it, all the fundamental human rights for which the world has been fighting for civilized centuries, have been abolished in Russia in order that the Communist experiment might be made. They have been suppressed by the Cheka.</p>
<p>The Cheka changed it's name to NKVD, then KGB, and is now FSB.  Call it Cheka, NKVD, KGB, FSB, Gestapo, or Homeland Security.  A national police force spells the end of freedom.</p>
<p>Support local, independent police because they are heroic, courageous, and serve a necessary function, in a free society.  Support them because if we don't, we will have, instead, an oppressive national police force.  History shows you get one or the other.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has been funding and equipping local police.  Remember that federal funds always include federal control.</p>
<p>Much of the information for this post came from James Fitzgerald, who spent eight years as a police detective in Newark, NJ.  He will be in the area in October, presenting a speech entitled <a href="https://federalexpression.wordpress.com/">"Support Your Local Police and Keep Them Independent".</a>  I urge you to attend and learn more about how to keep police accountable to local communities, so we can maintain our freedom as a nation.</p>
