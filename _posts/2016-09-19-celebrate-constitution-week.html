<p>On Monday September 17, 1787 our constitution was signed and offered, by the convention, to the U.S. Congress for approval, to be sent to the States for ratification.  For this reason, September 17 is Constitution Day and September 17-23 is Constitution Week.</p>
<p>In 2004, Public Law 108-447, Section 111 was passed.  It requires that:</p>
<p>“Each educational institution that receives Federal funds for a fiscal year shall hold an educational program on the United States Constitution on September 17 of such year for the students served by the educational institution”.</p>
<p>The Constitution is the solution to our economic problems and many other problems that plague our society.</p>
<p>Many don’t realize that, when the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 was convened, our nation was in an economic depression with wild inflation, much like today.  After living under the Constitution for just two years, our economy stabilized and we started on our destiny of becoming the greatest example of liberty and economic prosperity the world has ever known.</p>
<p>All we need is for people to understand the Constitution, then hold their elected officials to their oath to uphold and defend it.  A good start on this road would be to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MzxC8Mqupw">"Overview of America".</a><!--more--></p>
<p>To see if you need a better understanding of the Constitution, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where do our rights come from?  (hint: not government, the Bill of Rights, or the constitution)</li>
<li>What form of government are we guaranteed by the Constitution? (hint: it’s not democracy)</li>
<li>Are there limits on the power of the federal government? (hint:  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution and Amendment X)</li>
<li>Is it Unconstitutional to teach about God in a public (ie.Taxpayer-funded) school? (hint: read Amendment I of our Bill of Rights)</li>
<li>Can the President or the Supreme Court make law, according to the Constitution? (hint: read Article I, section 1 of the U.S. Constitution)</li>
<li>Do Federal Reserve Notes qualify as Constitutional money?</li>
<li>How is our economy affected by using Federal Reserve Notes, as money?</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/the-declaration-of-independence">The Declaration of Independence</a> states, as a self-evident truth, that men are “…endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, …”.  It list’s the right to Life, as first among these.  It then states the self-evident truth, “That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted…”   Our founders gave us here the bedrock of our liberty.  God created humans with rights, the first of which is life itself, and men form governments to protect their rights.</p>
<p><a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp">Article IV, section 4 </a>of the U.S. Constitution states, in part,” The United States shall <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-4-the-states-and-the-national-government/section-4-federal-duties-to-the-states/clause-1-representative-government-protection-against-invasion-and-rebellion">guarantee</a> to every state in <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-4-the-states-and-the-national-government/section-4-federal-duties-to-the-states/clause-1-representative-government-protection-against-invasion-and-rebellion">this Union</a> a <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-4-the-states-and-the-national-government/section-4-federal-duties-to-the-states/clause-1-representative-government-protection-against-invasion-and-rebellion">republican</a> form of government,…”</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed10.asp">In Federalist 10,</a> Madison explains the folly of pure Democracy and the need to establish a Republic,</p>
<p><strong>“Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Many similar quotes from our founders can be found in the convention debates and elsewhere.  There is no doubt that the common belief, that we are a democracy, is completely false.  In fact, our founders thought democracy the worst form of government.</p>
<p>There are some elected officials and many average citizens who feel that there are no limits to the power of our federal government.  Our founders recognized the need for a federal government but were very careful to delegate to it only the powers necessary to secure our rights.   <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-1-legislative-branch/section-8-powers-of-congress">Article I, section 8 </a>of the Constitution lists specific powers delegated to our federal government, by the States.    <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/amendments-to-the-us-constitution/the-bill-of-rights-amendments-1-10/preamble-to-the-bill-of-rights">The preamble of our Bill of Rights </a>states in part, “<strong>THE</strong> Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution”. <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/amendments-to-the-us-constitution/the-bill-of-rights-amendments-1-10"> Amendment X </a>of our Bill of Rights states “The powers not <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/amendments-to-the-us-constitution/the-bill-of-rights-amendments-1-10/amendment-10-undelegated-powers-kept-by-the-states-and-the-people">delegated</a> to the United States by the Constitution, nor <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/amendments-to-the-us-constitution/the-bill-of-rights-amendments-1-10/amendment-10-undelegated-powers-kept-by-the-states-and-the-people">prohibited</a> by <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/amendments-to-the-us-constitution/the-bill-of-rights-amendments-1-10/amendment-10-undelegated-powers-kept-by-the-states-and-the-people">it</a> to the states, are <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/amendments-to-the-us-constitution/the-bill-of-rights-amendments-1-10/amendment-10-undelegated-powers-kept-by-the-states-and-the-people">reserved</a> to the states <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/amendments-to-the-us-constitution/the-bill-of-rights-amendments-1-10/amendment-10-undelegated-powers-kept-by-the-states-and-the-people">respectively</a>, or to the people.”  Because many of our citizens do not understand the Constitution, our government officials over-step the clear bounds of the Constitution, to the detriment of all of us.</p>
<p><a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/amendments-to-the-us-constitution/the-bill-of-rights-amendments-1-10/amendment-1-freedom-of-religion-speech-and-the-press">Amendment I of the Bill of Rights </a>states in part, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;".  This clearly does not empower the federal government to prohibit prayer.  It prevents the government from creating a state religion and prohibits the federal government from meddling in the practice of religion by the people.</p>
<p><a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution">Article I, section 1 of the Constitution states,</a> “All <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-1-legislative-branch/section-1-all-law-making-power-in-congress">legislative powers</a> <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-1-legislative-branch/section-1-all-law-making-power-in-congress">herein</a> <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-1-legislative-branch/section-1-all-law-making-power-in-congress">granted</a> shall be <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-1-legislative-branch/section-1-all-law-making-power-in-congress">vested in</a> a <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-1-legislative-branch/section-1-all-law-making-power-in-congress">Congress</a> of the United States, which shall <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-1-legislative-branch/section-1-all-law-making-power-in-congress">consist of</a> a <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-1-legislative-branch/section-3-the-senate.php">Senate</a> and <a href="https://nccs.net/online-resources/us-constitution/article-1-legislative-branch/section-2-the-house-of-representatives.php">House of Representatives</a>.”  If Americans read and understand just the first sentence of our Constitution, after the preamble,  they can understand that, since all legislative (law-making) power is vested in Congress, zero law-making power is delegated to the President or the Supreme Court.  Executive Orders and Supreme Court decisions are not the law of the land.  The States need to assert their rights to ignore, and therefor nullify, federal edicts that are unconstitutional.</p>
<p>During the Constitutional Convention of 1787, our founders debated about delegating, to the federal government the power to emit Bills of Credit.  This was the power to print paper money, which would be backed with gold or silver.  Our founders decided not to delegate this power to the federal government.  The Constitution in Article I, section 10, even prohibits the States from emitting Bills of Credit or using anything but gold and silver to pay debts.  Madison states in <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed44.asp">Federalist 44,</a> “The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied;”</p>
<p>By allowing our government to emit Bills of Credit (print paper money), we have opened the door to the wild inflation which plagues our economy today.</p>
<p>I suggest that every American who wants liberty for themselves and future generations, study the Constitution and work to hold public officials to it.</p>
<p>Remember the advice of Thomas Jefferson, “In questions of power, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution”.</p>
