<p>Yesterday at Mass we had a wonderful priest from <em><strong><a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/" target="_blank"><u><span style="color: #0066cc;">'Priests for Life'</span></u></a>  </strong></em>give a beautiful homily on the sanctity of human life. So, since October is 'Respect Life' month and even though the month is almost over I wanted to take some time to post about this important topic.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>We all know that abortion is a hot topic and we've all heard the statistics--more than 56 million American babies have been murdered in the United States since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 (Roe v. Wade was a court decision which legalized abortion throughout the entire nine months of pregnancy). So it's really not about 'choice' anymore...you are either pro-life or pro-abortion. But it is about rights. We all have rights. Everyone has heard that line from the Declaration of Independence:</p>
<blockquote><p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are <strong>Life</strong>, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness...</p></blockquote>
<p>And I believe these rights start at conception. And I believe that no one has the right to take the life of another...whether they are in utero, deformed, or old. I believe in the sanctity of life from the moment of conception to natural death.</p>
<p>That being said, people do make mistakes and bad decisions.. Sometimes they feel they have no options. Sometimes they are forced to do something they do not want to do. So, for those women (and men) who struggle with the emotional and spiritual pain of abortion there is <a href="http://www.rachelsvineyard.org/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Rachel's Vineyard</strong></em></a>. Rachel's Vineyard offers weekend retreats for those suffering following an abortion.</p>
<p>But what can we do as individuals? First off, PRAY! Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen encouraged the spiritual adoption of an unborn child. You pray for one particular but unknown child's life. It is recommended that you say the following daily prayer for a period of nine months.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Jesus, Mary and Joseph, I love you very much. I beg you to spare the life of [baby's name] the unborn baby that I have spiritually adopted who is in danger of abortion."</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Holy Heroes has a great on-line <a href="http://www.holyheroes.com/Spiritual-Adoption-s/92.htm" target="_blank"><em><strong>Spiritual Adoption prayer adventure</strong></em></a> that you can do with kids. Check it out!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And elections will be coming up this November and November 2016. Please vote pro-life! <a href="http://nrlc.capwiz.com/election/home/" target="_blank"><em><strong>National Right to Life</strong></em></a> has an on-line election guide. Just enter your address and zip code and it will give you the candidates in your area and where they stand on <strong>LIFE</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As Father pointed out in his homily yesterday...Jesus came to us as an <em><strong>embryo</strong></em> at the Annunciation (March 25). Jesus didn't just show up on Christmas day as a newborn baby!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And the angel said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be call holy, the Son of God...And Mary said, "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word."  ~ Luke 1 : 35-38:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And then Mary went to see her cousin Elizabeth (the Visitation) who was in her sixth month of pregnancy. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe (John the Baptist) "leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy."  ~ Luke 1: 41-44</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, even the baby, John the Baptist, recognized Jesus as Lord while they were both in utero!</p>
