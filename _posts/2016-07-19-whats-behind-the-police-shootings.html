<p>We have<strong><a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/10/14/support-your-local-police-and-keep-them-independent/"> previously posted</a> </strong>about the attack on our local independent police.  In the wake of recent attacks on police in Texas and Louisiana, we should examine the causes.  To read a great explanation of the real causes behind this violence, <a href="http://www.jbs.org/mobile/jbs-news/featured-news/item/18286-what-s-behind-the-police-shootings"><strong>click here.</strong></a></p>
<p>It's now more important than ever that we support our local independent police.  The first step is to stay informed and understand the reasons for these attacks.  Please go to  the links above and share them with others.</p>
