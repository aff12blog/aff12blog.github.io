<p>In the aftermath of Brexit, Congressman Thomas Massie (Kentucky) posted on Facebook an image of H.R. 1205.  The caption read, "Time for #amex?  I'm a cosponsor of H.R. 1205 to get the U.S. out of the UN. #brexit".  When someone asked why it would be good to get out of the UN, Congressman Massie wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>"<strong>In one word, <em>Sovereignty.  </em>As a member of the UN, we bind our citizens to decisions made by undemocratic countries, when in fact our constitution should be the supreme law."</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The Congressman is right on target.  We need to support H.R. 1205, with phone calls and emails to our Congressman.</p>
<p>George Washington warned, in his farewell address, that entangling alliances would rob us of our independence.  The UN creates a web of entangling alliances.  If we want future Americans to celebrate our independence, we must get out of the UN.</p>
