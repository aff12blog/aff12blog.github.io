<p>As I mentioned in my previous ‘Chickens’ post we had bought an Easter Egger chick because they lay greenish/bluish eggs and thought that would be ‘cool’. Matt named our Easter Egger, Samus, after some video game character.<!--more--></p>
<p>Here is a picture of Samus…isn’t she pretty?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://aff12blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IMG_20150701_2031039_rewind.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-235 alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_20150701_2031039_rewind-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_20150701_2031039_rewind" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also knew that Samus would start laying eggs a little later than the other ‘girls’. Well, this past Thursday was a really rainy day here so I didn’t go out to check on them as much as I usually do. On Friday morning when I went to let them out and feed them I found a really small greenish/bluish egg laying under the ramp in the run. Samus must have laid a ‘practice’ egg the day before. I was so excited! When I went out at lunch time she had laid a ‘regular’ sized egg.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here’s a picture of both eggs…see what I mean about it being tiny?</p>

<p>And this past Friday they <b>ALL</b> laid an egg…I got <strong>SEVEN</strong> eggs in one day! Woo Hoo!!</p>
