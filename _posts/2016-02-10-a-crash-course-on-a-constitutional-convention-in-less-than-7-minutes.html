<p>There has been another PA call for an Article V Convention, just introduced.  <strong><a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&amp;sessYr=2015&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=R&amp;billNbr=0682&amp;pn=2825">HR 682 </a></strong>claims the need for a Convention to amend the Constitution, to empower the States to oppose federal edicts that encroach on State's rights.  The States already have that power, as we have <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/09/17/nullification-an-exercise-of-state-sovereignty/">previously explained.</a>  Our Constitution is not the problem and should not be amended.</p>
<p>We have already expressed, in <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2016/01/20/protect-our-constitution/"><strong>pasts posts</strong>,</a> that the Article V Convention method of amending the Constitution would be disastrous.  We hope<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TX2IaKI-wE&amp;feature=youtu.be"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A Crash Course on a Constitutional Convention</strong> </span></a> can explain, in 6 minutes and 50 seconds, why a Constitutional Convention is not the solution to America's problems and what the real solution is.</p>
<p>We strongly urge you to share this video and urge others to contact their State Representatives, in opposition to any PA calls for an Article V Convention.</p>
