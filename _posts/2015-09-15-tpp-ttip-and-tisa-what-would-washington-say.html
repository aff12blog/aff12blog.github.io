<blockquote>The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is <strong>in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible.</strong>.. It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world... But even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand, neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences;... constantly keeping in view that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from another; that<strong> it must pay with a portion of it's independence</strong> for whatever it may accept under that character.  (George Washington - Farewell Address - 1796) (emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>This advice from the father of our nation is wise.  However, President Obama is now working on economic <em>partnerships</em>, under the guise of "free trade", which will give away our independence just as George Washington warned, in the above quote.<!--more--></p>
<p>Senator Jeff Sessions (Alabama), recently wrote <a href="http://www.sessions.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/45aa77c1-94c4-4f9a-a6a1-7459e92c771f/letter-to-obama-on-pacific-union.pdf">a letter to Mr. Obama</a>, detailing his concerns about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).  Senator Sessions references a previous letter sent to President Obama, which received no response, <strong><em>"... I asked that you make public the section of the TPP that creates a new transnational governance structure known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission.  The details of this new governance commission are extremely broad and have the hallmarks of a nascent European Union,with many similarities."  </em></strong></p>
<p>Anyone familiar with the history of the European Union knows that the nations of Europe began their political Union with economic partnerships.  The European Steel and Coal Community  morphed into the European Economic Community and has now become, the political entity known as, the European Union.  Europe followed the path which George Washington warned the U.S. against.  The more the nations of Europe entangled themselves economically  the more their political connections increased and gradually each nation gave up some of their independence, until now the Union is complete.  Each nation in Europe has given up their individual independence.</p>
<p>Senator Sessions believes the TPP would move us in a similar direction.  While the TPP would set us up for economic and political merger with the Asian or "Pacific Rim" nations,  the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would actually begin to merge us with the European Union.  Another similar "free trade agreement" is the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA).  Like the TPP, the details are secret.  When the time is right the President will use his Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to hand the deal to the Senate for an up or down vote, without debate and without the American people knowing the details.</p>
<p>There's nothing free about these "free trade" agreements.  These deals would form economic partnerships that would erode our independence.  Eventually, we would have a political union that would keep us from exercising our rights, as an independent and Sovereign Nation.  The price of these "free trade" agreements is our freedom.</p>
<p>I urge you to watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blEd8fwVR3w">seven minute video, </a>in which Senator Sessions explains his concerns about the plan to create these trade partnerships/unions.  If you want to do something simple but constructive, you can call or email the appropriate government officials by going <a href="http://www.jbs.org/federal-legislative-action-alerts">here.</a>  I hope you will share this with others.</p>
