<p>While campaigning for office Mr. Trump said,  <b>“There’s never been a worse or a dumber deal for trade including TPP which is a disaster — but TPP I don't believe will be as bad as NAFTA. And as you know, Hillary Clinton totally wants to approve TPP.” </b>(Sept. 13 in Des Moines, Iowa).</p>
<p>President Trump terminated the TPP deal promptly after taking office.  I believe he would do the same with NAFTA but for pressure from the globalists.</p>
<div>Well known globalist Henry Kissinger said this about NAFTA,</div>

<p>In late April CNN reported in part:</p>
<p><em>Trump's decision to remain in NAFTA came the same day a senior administration official revealed the White House was considering an executive order to withdraw from the trade accord.</em></p>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><em>Last week, Trump derided NAFTA during remarks in Wisconsin meant to highlight American manufacturing.</em></div>
<div class="zn-body__paragraph"><em>"It's been very, very bad for our companies and for our workers, and we're going to make some very big changes, or we are going to get rid of NAFTA once and for all," Trump said.</em></div>
<div></div>

<div>
<div> <strong>President Trump is being pressured by globalists to renegotiate NAFTA, rather than terminate the agreement.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Trump's new trade representative, Robert Lighthizer (CFR), sent a letter to Congress on Thursday May 18th, triggering the renegotiation of NAFTA and outlining goals that sound very similar to the TPP. We must not let the globalists turn NAFTA into a North American Union (NAU), modeled after the European Union (EU).  The process begun with this letter is a consultation between The Trump Administration, Congress, and business.  By August 18th this process will end.</div>
<div></div>
<div>President Trump needs to hear from the people who agree with his assessment of NAFTA and the TPP, as expressed during his campaign.  He is feeling the pressure from the globalists, so he must hear from his constituents.</div>
<div>It was Congress who acted to involve us in NAFTA, so Congressional action will certainly be a part of terminating NAFTA.  We will need to apply pressure to our Senators and Representatives in Congress over the next two months.  In the spirit of #Brexit we should #Amexit NAFTA!</div>
</div>

<div>The fact that Lighthizer is CFR (i.e. a member of the Council on Foreign Relations) is especially important, since the CFR is a globalist group promoting a North American Union.  Read this article for more information:</div>
