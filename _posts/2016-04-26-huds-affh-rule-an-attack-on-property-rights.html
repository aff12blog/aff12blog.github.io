<blockquote>"In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is just what we intend." <strong> Karl Marx</strong> - <em>Communist Manifesto</em></p></blockquote>
<p>HUD is a Marxist idea for the government control of housing, so we should not be surprised that it's latest scheme would attack the rights of private property.  If HUD and the UN have their way,  rural property owners will be forced off their land and into city apartment complexes in the name of; ending poverty and hunger, ensuring good health, guaranteeing education and energy for all, building resilient infrastructure, and combating climate change.</p>
<p>HUD and the UN are prepared to solve all of our problems.  All it will cost is our property rights and liberty.  If you've ever read the Communist Manifesto, you know that Marx and Engels offered to solve the world's problems at the cost of individual liberty.  Why should we be surprised when our current socialist leaders devise plans along those lines?</p>
<p>If you are not ready to give up property rights for yourself and your children, I suggest you <a href="http://www.jbs.org/mobile/jbs-news/featured-news/item/18210-latest-agenda-21-outrage-hud-s-affh-rule">click here </a>for more information and a way to oppose this plan.</p>
