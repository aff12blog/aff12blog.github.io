<p>For those of us who were relieved to see eight years of Obama culture change fade into history, the news is not good.  Apparently the street organizer turned president refuses to let his  radical leftist changes be undone.</p>
<p>A recent article in The New York Post, "<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/02/11/how-obama-is-scheming-to-sabotage-trumps-presidency/">How Obama is Scheming to Sabotage Trump's Presidency"</a>, describes how our former president is using his nonprofit, multi-million dollar group, Organizing For Action (OFA) to create opposition to the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The Post reports,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"He’s doing it through a network of leftist nonprofits led by Organizing for Action. Normally you’d expect an organization set up to support a politician and his agenda to close up shop after that candidate leaves office, but not Obama’s OFA. Rather, it’s gearing up for battle, with a growing war chest and more than 250 offices across the country."</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The Post further reports,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Since Donald Trump’s election, this little-known but well-funded protesting arm has beefed up staff and ramped up recruitment of young liberal activists, declaring on its website, “We’re not backing down.” Determined to salvage Obama’s legacy, it’s drawing battle lines on immigration, ObamaCare, race relations and climate change.</strong></p></blockquote>
