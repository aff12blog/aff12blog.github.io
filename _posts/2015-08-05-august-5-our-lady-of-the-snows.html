<p>I just recently heard about this devotion to Mary and I was instantly intrigued and wanted to find out more, mostly because it is my daughter, Sara’s birthday AND my granddaughter, Emma’s birthday, too! Lots of reasons to celebrate!</p>
<p>Devotion to Mary under the title of <em>Our Lady of the Snows</em> is one of the oldest devotions to Mary.There is a legend about a marvelous snowfall in Rome in 352 A.D. Mary appeared in a dream to a wealthy but childless Roman couple that she wanted a church built in her honor and the <!--more-->site for this church would be covered with snow. On a hot, sultry morning on August 5, Esquiline Hill was covered with snow. Everyone in Rome proclaimed the summer snow a miracle, and a church to honor Mary was built on the hill six years later in 358 A.D. It has been restored and refurbished many times.</p>
<p>This church, now known as the Basilica of St. Mary Major, still stands today as the seat of devotion to our Lady of the Snows in the Catholic Church. Saint Mary Major is the oldest church in the West dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer to Our Lady of the Snows:</strong></p>
<p><em>Our Lady of the Snows, Immaculate Queen of the Universe, from this privileged sanctuary, Thou has bestowed so many countless graces and pledges of love upon the hearts and souls of millions. O Mother, from this cradle of Christianity, this Mother Church of all churches, deign to shower forth the graces of thine Immaculate Heart upon the remnant Faithful throughout the world, wherever they may be, and grant them the graces of a childlike love and unwavering fidelity to the holy truths of our Faith. Grant, good Mother, to the faithful Bishops of the Church the grace to defend her Sacred Teachings and to persevere courageously against all the enemies of the Holy Church. Amen.</em></p>
<p><em>**********************************************************************************************</em></p>
<p>So, on this day, in addition to birthday cake I think my girls and I are going to make snowball cookies! We’ll use my mom’s Christmas cookie recipe:</p>
<p><strong>SNOWBALL COOKIES</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup butter</li>
<li>¼ cup 10X sugar (powdered sugar)</li>
<li>1 ½ tsp water</li>
<li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
<li>1 cup chopped walnuts (or pecans)</li>
<li>2 cups flour</li>
<li>¼ tsp salt</li>
<li>Powdered sugar (for rolling)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cream butter and 10X sugar. Add remaining ingredients and mix well. Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place 1 inch apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 12 minutes or until very lightly browned. Cool for 5 minutes. Roll in powdered sugar.</p>
<p>**********************************************************************************************</p>
<p>And since I am really getting into gardening I think we may try to plant some Snow in Summer (Cerastium).</p>

<p>We’ll get a flower pot, add some soil, plant the seeds and wait for it to grow. We’ll print a picture of our Lady of the Snows and make a garden marker for our new plant.</p>
