<p>According to Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, maybe so.  I recommend reading this article from The Tenth Amendment Center blog,</p>
<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="https://blog.tenthamendmentcenter.com/2018/09/pennsylvania-bill-would-set-foundation-to-build-a-gun-rights-sanctuary-state/">Pennsylvania Bill Would Set Foundation to Build a Gun Rights “Sanctuary State”</a></h1>
<p>The article reports that the Right to Bear<br />
Arms Protection Act, House Bill 357(<a href="https://legiscan.com/PA/text/HB357/2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://legiscan.com/PA/text/HB357/2017&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536931679262000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4aXaw2f8ByCnYI9ECls1WqlkxGQ">HB357</a>) , was introduced by Rep. Daryl Metcalfe (R- Cranberry Township)on Sept. 5, with 41 bipartisan cosponsors.  The bill would render any Federal law which attempts to register, restrict or ban a firearm, or to limit the size of a magazine of a firearm, “unenforceable within the borders of this Commonwealth.” This restriction would apply to both federal and state agents.</p>
<p>Judge Napolitano <a href="http://blog.tenthamendmentcenter.com/2014/08/andrew-napolitano-federal-gun-laws-nearly-impossible-to-enforce-without-state-assistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://blog.tenthamendmentcenter.com/2014/08/andrew-napolitano-federal-gun-laws-nearly-impossible-to-enforce-without-state-assistance/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536931679262000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNcPqHnDz1J5BgRlsRrhhPa6e3Rw">noted that a single state taking this step</a> would make federal gun laws “nearly impossible” to enforce.<!--more--></p>
<p>HB357 was referred to the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/cteeInfo/Index.cfm?Code=24&amp;CteeBody=H" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Judiciary Committee</a> where it must pass by a majority vote before moving forward in the legislative process.</p>
<p>The fake news media has been pushing hard for federal and State control of gun ownership, supposedly to curtail mass shootings.  I won't go into the lack of logic and the sinister purpose behind the media push for gun control, except to say criminals don't obey gun laws.  For more information on this topic, watch this video segment from "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmmlO-9JpCA&amp;feature=youtu.be">Are Guns to Blame?</a>".</p>
<p>Every Pennsylvanian, every U.S. citizen, and every person on earth has a God given right to defend themselves, their family, and their property, with a gun or with any force necessary.  The Second Amendment is an attempt to protect that God-given right.  The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania says that right shall not be questioned.</p>
<p>Rep Metcalfe and the 41 co-sponsors of HB 357 are to be commended for introducing this legislation.  James Madison would be proud.  How do we know that?  In <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed46.asp">Federalist # 46,</a> Madison explained what the States and people should do "should an unwarrantable measure of the federal government be unpopular in particular States".  He suggested in part, "refusal to co-operate with the officers of the Union".  Madison further explains, "the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large State, very serious impediments; and where the sentiments of several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter".</p>
<p>The Right to Bear Arms Protection Act, House Bill 357(<a href="https://legiscan.com/PA/text/HB357/2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://legiscan.com/PA/text/HB357/2017&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1536931679262000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF4aXaw2f8ByCnYI9ECls1WqlkxGQ">HB357</a>) is currently awaiting a Majority vote in the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/cteeInfo/Index.cfm?Code=24&amp;CteeBody=H">State House Judiciary Committee.</a>  Pennsylvanians need to make their voice heard, to move the process forward so that HB 357 becomes law.</p>
<p>Here's what each of us can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send emails at least and perhaps use snail mail and phone calls to thank Rep. Metcalfe and the cosponsors for introducing <a href="https://legiscan.com/PA/text/HB357/2017">HB 357.</a></li>
<li> Contact each member of the <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/CteeInfo/index.cfm?Code=24&amp;CteeBody=H">Judiciary Committee</a> urging support of <a href="https://legiscan.com/PA/text/HB357/2017">HB 357</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/contact.cfm?body=H">Contact your own State Representative</a> by phone, email, and snail mail to urge his support of<a href="https://legiscan.com/PA/text/HB357/2017"> HB 357.</a></li>
<li>Contact your<a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/contact.cfm?body=S"> State Senator</a> to ask for companion legislation in the  <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/mbrList.cfm?body=S&amp;sort=alpha">State Senate.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If each of us does this and shares this with others, the pressure will mount and this legislation will become law.</p>
