<p>Hopefully, we made clear in our <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/09/11/remember-911-by-supporting-local-independent-police/">9/11 post</a>, the importance of supporting local and <strong>independent </strong>police.  Local police, independent of federal government controls, and beholden to the communities they serve, are an important part of our free society.  They certainly need our support and our vigilance, to keep them independent of an expanding federal government.  In the <a href="http://aff12blog.com/2015/09/11/remember-911-by-supporting-local-independent-police/">9/11 post</a>, we explained that the uprisings in Ferguson and elsewhere have been paid for by<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/14/george-soros-funds-ferguson-protests-hopes-to-spur/?page=all"> George Soros,</a> with organization and manpower provided by the socialist international.  This kind of rioting applies pressure to local law enforcement.  At the same time, the Obama administration has been offering equipment and training to local police forces, which would turn them into a military style force, beholden to the federal government.  This <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/21582-obama-and-allies-seek-to-nationalize-local-polic">article from The New American,</a> provides some background information.  Mentioned in the article, is a former Newark, NJ police detective named, Jim Fitzgerald.  Mr. Fitzgerald will be At the Towamencin Firehouse, next Wednesday (10/21), at 7:30 pm.  For more information, go <a href="https://federalexpression.wordpress.com/">here.</a>  I urge you to go and listen to what Mr. Fitzgerald has to say.  He has so much knowledge to impart, on this important topic.  I also recommend that you read this <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/files/TNA3118.pdf">special issue of The New American</a> magazine.</p>
<p>I remind you that funds, training, and equipment from the federal government to our local police, will mean federal control over police.  Nationalized police, such as the gestapo and KGB, are necessary to control people in a slave state, while local independent police are an important element in a free nation.</p>
