<p>On March 4, 2018 Fox News' Next Revolution, hosted by Steve Hilton, ran a 10 minut<span class="text_exposed_show">e segment promoting the Convention of States. It was full of the same propaganda consistently spread by Mark Meckler and his Convention of States Action (COS). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdWf3XX7Bs"> Click here for the YouTube video.</a></span></p>
<p>Hilton begins by claiming that although more and more power is being centralized in Washington the COS movement would "give States more of a say, when it comes to governing".  Fox corespondent Anita Vogel describes the scene as the Texas legislature reacts to passing COS legislation in May of 2017.   She explains that Meckler and the COS intend to have a convention aimed at crafting proposals to shift power back to the people and some goals are;  to reduce federal regulation, impose term limits on Congress, and force a balanced budget.  She then claims that Article V says 2/3 of the States shall call a Convention.  Actually <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution/article-v.html">Article V</a> says <strong>Congress</strong> <strong>calls</strong> the Convention, once 2/3 of the<strong> States apply. </strong> It's an important distinction, since Meckler and the COS try to convince us that an Article V Convention would bypass Congress, empowering the States and people.  The truth is Congress calls the <!--more-->Convention and chooses the method of ratification for any changes to our Constitution.  Congress will undoubtedly attempt further control over an Article V Convention by saying the "necessary and proper clause" empowers them.  This kind of challenge would likely get the federal courts involved.</p>
<p>Attorney Troy Slaten is shown claiming that our founders gave us Article V because they were "suspicious of the strong federal government seizing too much power".  He then explains that the safe guard against bad changes is that 38 of 50 States must approve the changes.  He doesn't explain why we still got  the 16th and 17th Amendments, with the same ratification requirement.</p>
<p>Meckler is then shown explaining that he sometimes imagines Ben Franklin saying to him, "Mr. Meckler have you used Article V? We gave it to you for this purpose".  Well I don't claim to converse with any of our founders, but we can get the truth from James Madison in Federalist Paper #43.  As you may know, Madison, Hamilton, and Jay wrote letters to the New York newspapers, explaining our Constitution before it was ratified.  The Federalist Papers are the compilation of those letters.  James Madison, Father of the Constitution, explains in Federalist #43 paragraph 8 that Article V would allow for "the amendment of errors" in our Constitution.  He also makes reference to "its discovered faults".</p>
<p><em><b>The truth is that the concentration of power in Washington is not due to errors in the Constitution.  Our federal government has been allowed to usurp power not granted to it, by the U. S. Constitution.</b></em></p>
<p>Who allowed this usurpation?</p>
<p>1. Our elected officials in Washington, who have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution.                                                                                                                          2. Our State elected officials, who also take an oath to uphold the U. S. Constitution.                                                                                                                          3.  The people ultimately have a duty to know their                             Constitution and hold elected officials accountable.</p>
<p>What advice does Madison offer for our current situation?  In Federalist #46 Madison wrote, "should an unwarrantable measure of the federal government be unpopular in particular States... the means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand. The disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to co-operate with the officers of the Union; the frowns of the executive magistracy of the State; the embarrassments created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would oppose, in any State, difficulties not to be despised; would form, in a large State, very serious impediments; and where the sentiments of several adjoining States happened to be in unison, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter".</p>
<p>Hamilton, in Federalist #16, gives this advice, "If the interposition of the State legislatures be necessary to give effect to a measure of the Union, they have only <b>NOT TO ACT</b>, or to <b>ACT EVASIVELY</b>, and the measure is defeated".</p>
<p>Amendment X in our Bill of Rights says, "<strong>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people". </strong></p>
<p>Simply stated, we don't need a convention to shift power from the federal government to the States and people.  We already have the power.  We must use it.  When the people and the States are unhappy with a federal act, they simply should oppose it.  State officials can refuse the federal funds and say no to implementing the unconstitutional program.  The people can make their voice heard with phone calls, faxes, emails, snail mail, petitions, and ultimately with their vote.</p>
<p>To those who claim we need to amend the Constitution to reduce federal regulation and balance the budget I say, if the Constitution were obeyed there would be almost zero federal regulation.  We would have a balanced budget.  In fact our government would be about 20% of its current size and cost.  The real solution to our current problems is not Article V but Article VI.  Article VI requires that every elected official, both federal and State, take an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution.  We must hold them to that oath.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To those who want term limits I ask that you read Federalist 72, in which Hamilton writes, of <strong>term limits, "<em>Nothing appears more plausible at first sight, nor more ill-founded upon close inspection,"  </em></strong>He then gives five reasons why we should not limit terms.  Here is his first, "One ill effect of the exclusion would be a diminution of the inducements to good behavior".</p>
<p>As the Fox program continues, Hillary Clinton and a host of liberal "progressive" groups are shown to be against a Constitutional Convention.  This is supposed to be proof that Meckler's Convention of States Action (COS) is good.</p>
<p>Hilton then speaks with, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member,  Pete Hegseth.  He begins by admitting, "Pete you first put me on to this.  You told me about the Convention".  Hegseth (CFR) makes it sound like COS is having lots of success, because 12 States passed COS convention calls and 30 more states are considering it.  The truth is the CFR has been wanting to change our Constitution in Convention for decades, starting with the World Federalists in the 1940's, then the Committee on the Constitutional System in the 1980's,  The Conference of the States in the 1990's, and now The Convention of States Action.  For the last few years the COS has been well funded enough that Meckler can fly around the nation in a private jet, trying to drum up support for his convention.  Considering this, a mere 12 of a needed 34 States in support of COS is not impressive.</p>
<p>The Committee on the Constitutional System revealed their agenda for a convention back in the 1980's.<em><strong> “Let us face reality: The framers [of the Constitution] have simply been too shrewd for us. They have outwitted us. They designed separate institutions that cannot be unified by mechanical linkages, frail bridges, tinkering. If we are to turn the founders upside down --- to put together what they put asunder --- we must confront the constitutional structure they erected".</strong> </em>- James MacGregor Burns, pg 160 of "Reforming American Government" Edited by Donald L. Robinson.</p>
<p>Hilton later asks Hegseth (CFR) why the left and particularly Hillary Clinton is against COS.  Hegseth (CFR) replies "we shall be known by our enemies" specifically pointing out that Hillary brought this up "unprompted".   That made me laugh, since Hillary Clinton has admitted to having ties to the CFR.</p>
<p>On July 15, 2009, Clinton spoke to the Washington DC satellite facility of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2009a/july/126071.htm">CFR where she stated</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>I am delighted to be here in these new headquarters. I have been often to, I guess, the mother ship in New York City, but it’s good to have an outpost of the Council right here down the street from the State Department.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>We get a lot of advice from the Council, so this will mean I won’t have as far to go to be told what we should be doing and how we should think about the future.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>The entire ten minute segment is a shameless promotion of the CFR plan to destroy our Constitution in Convention, under cover of a supposed grass roots effort to shift power from the federal government to the people.  Any conservative American is supposed to support the idea, since Hillary claims to oppose it.  Make no mistake Meckler and the COS are ensnaring patriotic Americans in an effort that's designed to result in disaster for our Constitution and our Republic.</p>
