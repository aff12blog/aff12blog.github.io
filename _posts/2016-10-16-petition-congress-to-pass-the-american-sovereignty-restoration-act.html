<p>Congressman Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) has introduced HR 1205 The American Sovereignty Restoration Act.  This legislation would get the U.S. out of the UN. Please sign the petition, asking Congress to pass HR 1205.  You will find it by <a href="https://www.petition2congress.com/22424/we-support-hr-1205-american-sovereignty-restoration-act">clicking here.</a></p>
<p>Your tax dollars support the UN, while it promotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abortion on demand, as a "right"</li>
<li>Common Core Education, on an international scale</li>
<li>An end to the right to keep and bear arms</li>
<li>Control of private property through Agenda 21 (now Agenda 2030)</li>
<li>Sovereignty destroying trade deals (e.g. NAFTA &amp; TPP)</li>
<li>"Refugees" relocated to the U.S. by order of the UN High Commissioner of Refugees</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't want your money used this way, <a href="https://www.petition2congress.com/22424/we-support-hr-1205-american-sovereignty-restoration-act">click here and sign the petition </a>then share it with everyone you can.</p>
<p>In a<a href="http://aff12blog.com/2016/07/05/happy-independence-day-but-is-america-independent/"> recent blog post</a>, we shared the suggestion of Congressman Thomas Massie that in the wake of #Brexit, it's time for #Amexit from the UN.  Massie indicated that our membership in the UN attacks our sovereignty, by tying us to nations whose governments do not have our love of freedom.</p>
<p>October 24th is UN Day.  It should be considered a day of shame.  Our Constitution stipulates that only Congress can declare war.  Yet, since we joined the UN, our President has been sending our military to police the world, under UN command.  This circumvention of the Constitution is bad enough.  What's worse is that our loyal military is now associated with the UN "peacekeeping" forces.  These "peacekeepers" are notorious for abusing women and children, all over the world.  October 24th is fast approaching.  Let's celebrate the UN Day of shame, by petitioning Congress to pass HR 1205 The American Sovereignty Restoration Act.</p>
