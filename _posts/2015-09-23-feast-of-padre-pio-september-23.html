<p>Today is the Feast of Padre Pio...one of my top 10 favorite saints! It's also my dad's birthday (he would have been 83 years old this year...so I'll be saying a prayer for him). My mom loved Padre Pio...not sure why but she read about him and had a lot of prayer cards and information about him. My son, Jon, took 'Pio' as his Confirmation name. So, needless to say, Padre Pio is close to my heart for a lot reasons.</p>

<p>And I love the message above. Really and truly when all else fails...PRAY!</p>

<p>Padre Pio was born in the Italian village of Pietrelcina in 1887. He was a sickly child and always wanted to be a priest. He was too sick to attend seminary but was permitted to study with the local priest while living at home. He was ordained a Capuchin and took the name Padre Pio. Interesting events started to happen in his life. While praying before the cross on September 20, 1918, he received the stigmata.  He also had the gift of bi-location. During World War II even though Padre Pio never left the monastery, pilots saw him standing in the clouds telling them not to bomb there and no bombs fell near the monastery. He listened to confessions 12 hours a day and knew the hearts of the penitents and told them what they had done, how to fix their lives, and how to grow closer to God. He saw the need for a hospital and founded the Relief of Suffering hospital. He supervised the construction, staffing and fundraising all while continuing his ministry.</p>
<p>There are no records but he converted many, changed countless lives in the confessional, and saved numerous lives in his hospital.</p>
<p>Today would be a good day to have a nice Italian dinner followed with a cannoli and cappuccino in his honor.</p>
<h2 id="inter-pp" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Prayer for the Intercession of St. Pio of Pietrelcina</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dear God, You generously blessed Your servant,<br />
St. Pio of Pietrelcina,<br />
with the gifts of the Spirit.<br />
You marked his body with the five wounds<br />
of Christ Crucified, as a powerful witness<br />
to the saving Passion and Death of Your Son.<br />
Endowed with the gift of discernment,<br />
St. Pio labored endlessly in the confessional<br />
for the salvation of souls.<br />
With reverence and intense devotion<br />
in the celebration of Mass,<br />
he invited countless men and women<br />
to a greater union with Jesus Christ<br />
in the Sacrament of the Holy Eucharist.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Through the intercession of St. Pio of Pietrelcina,<br />
I confidently beseech You to grant me<br />
the grace of (here state your petition).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Glory be to the Father… (three times). AImen.</p>
