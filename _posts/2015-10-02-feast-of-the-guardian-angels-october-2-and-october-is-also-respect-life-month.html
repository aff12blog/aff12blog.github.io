<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Beside each believer stands an angel as protector and shepherd, leading him to life</em>. Â ~ St. Basil the Great</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://aff12blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/attachment-2015-09-28-081325.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-359" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/attachment-2015-09-28-081325-242x300.jpeg" alt="attachment-2015-09-28-081325" width="242" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is one of the first prayers we taught our kids and we said it with them at bedtime every night. I read once that you can send your Guardian Angel to help others. So, I often find myself saying this prayer to my Guardian Angel and asking them to go help/protect another (usually always one of my kids...before a big test, a big game, when they are learning to drive...you get the idea). So, needless to say with ten kids I find myself sending my Guardian Angel to a lot of different places! It's a wonder he has time for me! But I recently found the prayer below which I am going to start saying daily...and I like that it also includes my husband and my whole family!</p>

<div id="page-content" class="col-md-8" style="text-align: center;"><em>I humbly salute you, O you faithful, heavenly Friends of my children! I give you heartfelt thanks for all the love and goodness you show them. At some future day I shall, with thanks more worthy than I can now give, repay your care for them, and before the whole heavenly court acknowledge their indebtedness to your guidance and protection. Continue to watch over them. Provide for all their needs of body and soul. Pray, likewise, for me, for my husband, and my whole family, that we may all one day rejoice in your blessed company.</em><br />
<em>Amen.</em></div>

<div class="col-md-8" style="text-align: left;">October is also Respect Life Month. Tonight we will read <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Angel-Waters-Regina-Doman/dp/1928832814/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1443799735&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Angel in the Waters</a></em> by Regina Doman. Or you can read it on-line <a href="http://reginadoman.com/CP_book_previews/AITW-hardcover-2014-online/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It is a beautiful book about a tiny baby growing in their mother's womb who talks to their angel who is there.</div>

<div class="col-md-8" style="text-align: left;">My dad loved jigsaw puzzles. He would finish a puzzle and glue it together and then my mom would take it to a craft store to get framed. They had a bunch of puzzles hanging up that he put together. And they gave a few to us. My favorite is this one that my dad made for my kids:</div>
