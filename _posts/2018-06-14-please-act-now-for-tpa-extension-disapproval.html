<p>We are re-posting from the Federal Expressions blog. Please click the link below for this important information.</p>
<p>We have a short window of opportunity to disapprove this unconstitutional Trade Promotion Authority (fast-track). TPA extension disapproval will cripple the globalistâ€™s ability to pass their sovereignty-destroying trade deals.</p>
<p>Even those who respect President Trump, for his opposition to the globalist deep state, should urge Congress to disapprove TPA. Congressional disapproval will not only end an unconstitutional power but will make it easier for President Trump to oppose the globalists and future Presidents would no longer have the power to fast-track globalist deals, which destroy U.S. sovereignty.</p>
