<p>Today is another day that I wanted to pick a really great quote to post on this special Feast Day but there are SO MANY great quotes that I couldn't just pick one...so I'll post some of my favorites:</p>
<blockquote><p>Never will anyone who says the Rosary every day become a formal heretic or be led astray by the devil.  ~ St. Louis De Montfort</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Some people are so foolish that they think they can go through life without the help of the Blessed Mother. Love the Madonna and pray the rosary, for her Rosary is the weapon against the evils of the world today. All graces given by God pass through the Blessed Mother.  ~ St. Padre Pio</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The greatest method of praying is to pray the Rosary.  ~ St. Francis de Sales</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Rosary is the best therapy for these distraught, unhappy, fearful, and frustrated souls. Precisely because it involves the simultaneous use of three powers: the physical, the vocal, and the spiritual.</p>
<p>~ Venerable Fulton Sheen</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Rosary is a long chain that links heaven and earth. One end of it is in our hands and the other end is in the hands of the holy Virgin...The Rosary prayer rises like incense to the feet of the Almighty. Mary responds at once like a beneficial dew, bringing new life to human hearts.  ~ St. Therese of Lisieux</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Rosary is a fortress against evil. It is a sign to Satan that you belong to Our Lady.  ~ St. Dominic</p></blockquote>

<p>And here's an excellent article about praying...and contemplating...on the Rosary...not just 'saying' it. You can read it <a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/the-rosary-pray-it-dont-just-say-it-priest-exhorts-95976/"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a>.</p>
