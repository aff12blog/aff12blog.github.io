<p>John King, Obama's Secretary of Education, is apparently concerned about home schooled children.  He made comments to that effect, at a recent event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.  I'm not sure if he's concerned that they make the government school students look bad by comparison or if his concerns stem from not being able to control and dumb down home-educated students, as well as the government school students.   You can be the judge.  Read this article from the New American, by clicking <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/education/item/24162-obama-s-education-secretary-concerned-about-homeschooling">here.</a></p>
<p>I signed a petition, on citizengo.org, to ask Mr. King to reconsider his comments.  If you want to sign the petition go <a href="http://www.citizengo.org/en/fm/37408-tell-sectary-education-john-king-check-facts-homeschooling?m=5&amp;tcid=27649588">here.</a></p>
