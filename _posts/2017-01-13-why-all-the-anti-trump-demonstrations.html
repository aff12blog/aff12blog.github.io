<p>Many Trump supporters believe these demonstrations are just immature liberal whiners acting out.  There is much more to it than that.  William F. Jasper has recently addressed this topic in an article for The New American Magazine.  I urge you to <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/25074-ny-times-aids-communist-socialist-feminist-lgbt-anarchist-plans-for-inauguration-day-mayhem">click here </a>and read the article.  In part of the article, Mr. Jasper takes a look at a recent ad published in the NY Times:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The Workers World Party is not the only totalitarian-oriented organization promoting anti-Trump mayhem for Inauguration Day — not by a long stretch. Another veteran communist group, the <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/item/10132-call-for-may-day-offensive-reveals-communist-direction-of-occupy-wall-street-movement">Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP)</a>, is a violent Marxist-Leninist organization that idolizes Chinese mass-murdering dictator Mao Tse-tung. Operating through a front organization, www.refusefascism.org, the RCP took out a <a href="https://refusefascism.org/wp-content/uploads/nyt-no-16-1-4.pdf" target="_blank">full-page advertisement in the New York Times</a> on January 4 that is noteworthy on several points. First of all is the fact that the Times ran the ad at all, inasmuch as the Times’ declared policy is, "We do not accept opinion advertisements that are attacks of a personal nature."</em></p>
<p><em>Really? No “attacks of a personal nature?" That’s very PC and all, but why then does the RCP ad not qualify as an attack of a personal nature? After all, it does charge Trump and Pence and the incoming “regime” they are leading with being fascists, xenophobic nationalists, racists, and misogynists — among other execrable things.</em></p>
<p><em>The Times ad opens with the declaration: “NO! IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY WE REFUSE TO ACCEPT A FASCIST AMERICA!”</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Jasper shows what should be obvious to those who look at the signs used in these demonstrations.  These demonstrations, like those against the police, are not spontaneous reactions of "the people" but planned radical activities of organized Communists and Socialists.  They put their websites right on the signs.  The NY Times seems to have no problem advertising for these radicals even against their stated policies.</p>
<p>What do these Communists and Socialists hope to gain, by these demonstrations?  In the January 2017 Bulletin of the John Birch Society, Mr. Arthur Thompson gave some plausible possibilities.  I will paraphrase him here:</p>
<ol>
<li>To negate the letdown over the election.  They are now engaged in action rather than lamenting their loss.</li>
<li>These demonstrations can provide an excuse for more police power.  The drive to federalize our police can be strengthened by this.</li>
<li>To put pressure on the new administration.  The hope is that Trump will cut back on his promises to avoid possible violence throughout the nation.</li>
<li>To provide an excuse for questioning or altering the election results.</li>
<li>To lay the groundwork for a future move against the Electoral College and a radical change in the way elections are held and votes counted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Communism is certainly not dead.  These radical forces want to change our Republic and these demonstrations are an obvious attempt in that direction.</p>
<p>Support Your Local Police and Keep Them Independent!</p>
