<p>"A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars." ~ Revelation 12:1</p>
<p>Another Marian feast! Today we celebrate The Coronation – or Queenship of Mary - Mary being crowned queen of heaven and earth. Today’s feast follows the Solemnity of the Assumption of Mary by one week or on its “octave” which is fitting as she has just been assumed into heaven and is now seated next to her king.</p>

<p>The above painting, <strong>Coronation of the Virgin</strong>, is a painting by Diego Valazquez. It depicts the Holy Trinity crowning the Blessed Virgin Mary. It's composition is based on an inverted triangle which gives the appearance of a heart in both its color and form. A beautiful picture!</p>

<p>Tonight during family prayer (hopefully around the campfire) we will pray the 5<sup>th</sup> Glorious Mystery of the Rosary – The Coronation - and recite The Litany of Loreto and maybe even sing the Hail Holy Queen.</p>
