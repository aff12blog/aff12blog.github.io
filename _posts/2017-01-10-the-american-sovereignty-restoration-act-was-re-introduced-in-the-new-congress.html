<p>Alex Newman reported the following, in <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/congress/item/25078-bill-to-get-u-s-out-of-un-introduced-in-new-congress">a recent article in The New American Magazine; </a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>"H.R.193 was re-introduced in the 115th Congress on January 3, the first day of the new Congress, by Representative Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) and a coalition of liberty-minded lawmakers. While the full text of the legislation is not yet available online, sources on Capitol Hill confirmed that the bill was the same as <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/congress/item/21058-congressman-mike-rogers-introduces-bill-to-get-u-s-out-of-un">H.R. 1205 of the 114th Congress, also known as the American Sovereignty Restoration Act</a>. The new bill is currently going under the header, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/193/" target="_blank">“To end membership of the United States in the United Nations.”</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I strongly urge you to read this:</p>

<p>Newman presents some of  Representative Rogers' reasons for introducing this bill;</p>
<blockquote><p>In a <a href="https://mikerogers.house.gov/press-release/report-washington-restoring-and-protecting-american-sovereignty" target="_blank">statement</a> announcing the bill in the last Congress, chief sponsor Representative Rogers explained the reasons why he and many of his constituents in East Alabama wanted to end U.S. government participation in the UN immediately. “The U.N. continues to prove it’s an inefficient bureaucracy and a complete waste of American tax dollars,” the congressman said, echoing widespread concerns about the international outfit expressed across America and worldwide.</p>
<p>Beyond just being a waste, it is also a threat to U.S. interests, sovereignty, allies, and liberties, the Alabama Republican warned. “Why should the American taxpayer bankroll an international organization that works against America’s interests around the world?” he asked. “The time is now to restore and protect American sovereignty and get out of the United Nations.”</p>
<p>The congressman cited<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/item/19851-united-nations-exploits-pseudo-human-rights-to-attack-u-s"> attacks on U.S. liberties as a key motivation for the legislation</a>. “Although the United States makes up almost a quarter of the U.N.’s annual budget, the U.N. has attempted a number of actions that attack our rights as U.S. citizens,” he explained in the statement. “To name a few, these initiatives include actions like the Law of the Sea Treaty, which would subject our country to internationally based environmental mandates, costing American businesses more money, or the U.N.’s work to re-establish an international regulation regime on global warming which would heavily target our fossil fuels.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to explain other concerns expressed by supporters of HR193.  These concerns include attacks on our right to keep and bear arms, criminal acts committed by UN "peacekeepers", and the Anti-Israel bent of the UN.</p>
<p>I find myself in agreement with Sarah Palin, as quoted by Newman;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>...former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who has become increasingly vocal since Brexit in calling for the United States to sever the UN “shackles” binding America. “I called for our next president, Donald Trump, to call for the unshackling of the political bands tying us to the UN,” Palin <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/foreign-policy/item/24979-get-the-us-out-of-the-un">said in a recent radio interview</a>. “It’s our money funding the lion’s share of the globalist circus. It’s We the People needing to rise up and make this a part of the revolution that we have just so benefited from.”</strong></p></blockquote>
