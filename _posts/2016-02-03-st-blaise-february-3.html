<p>St. Blaise became a priest and then bishop of Sebaste in Armenia which is now modern Turkey. He had the gift of healing and both men and animals were brought to him to be healed. It is said that, as he was being led to his martyrdom, a poor mother rushed up to St. Blaise. She begged him to save her child who was choking to death from a fishbone. The saint whispered a prayer and blessed the child. He worked a miracle that saved the child's life. That is why St. Blase is called upon by all who have throat diseases. <!--more-->On his feast day, we have our throats blessed. We ask him to protect us from all sicknesses of the throat.</p>
<p>Prayer to St. Blaise or Blase for protection, particularly from afflictions of the throat:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>O glorious St. Blaise, who by your martyrdom left to the Church a precious witness to the Faith, obtain for us the grace to preserve within ourselves this divine gift, and to defend — without concern for human respect — both by word and example, the truth of that same Faith, which is so wickedly attacked and slandered in these our times. You miraculously restored a little child who was at the point of death because of an affliction of the throat.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Grant us your mighty protection in similar misfortunes. And, above all, obtain for us the grace of Christian mortification, together with faithful observance of the precepts of the Church, which keep us from offending almighty God. Amen.</strong></em></p>
