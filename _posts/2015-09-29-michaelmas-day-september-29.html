<p>Happy Feast of Saints Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael! The archangels are entrusted with important missions to mankind. In times of temptation and for protection we pray to St. Michael. For safety in travel and to do God's will we pray to Gabriel. For healing of sickness and finding a spouse we pray to Raphael.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world - he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.  ~ Revelation 12:7-9</em></p>

<p>At one time it was customary to eat goose on this day (according to Irish and English folk belief, eating goose on this day is said to protect against financial hardship). Apples were also harvested at this time so having apples with your goose is a good idea. Did you know that when you cut a cross section of an apple the 5 seeds inside the 5-pointed star found inside represent the Five Wounds of Christ?</p>
<p>According to an old Irish folk tale, blackberries were supposed to be harvested and used up by September 29 because when Satan was kicked out of Heaven he landed on a blackberry patch and he returns each year to curse and spit on the fruits of the plant that he landed on making them inedible after this day.</p>
<p>To celebrate, I will pack a Drake's 'devil dog' in the kids' lunches (shhh...its a surprise!). And for dinner we will have a feast of roasted chicken with potatoes and carrots, string beans and homemade apple sauce. For dessert we will have blackberry cobbler.</p>
