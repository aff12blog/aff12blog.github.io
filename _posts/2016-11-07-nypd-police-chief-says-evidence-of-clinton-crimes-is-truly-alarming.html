<p>According to a recent article in The New American magazine, the NYPD chief of police has seen evidence, on ex-congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop computer, that could "put Hillary and her crew away for life".  The list of crimes alluded to includes:</p>
<p>• Money laundering</p>
<p>• Child exploitation</p>
<p>• Sex crimes with minors (children)</p>
<p>• Perjury</p>
<p>• Pay to play through Clinton Foundation</p>
<p>• Obstruction of justice</p>
<p>• Other felony crimes</p>
<p>The national news media will not bring the truth to light.  FBI Director James Comey and the Justice Department are in no hurry to share this information publicly.  <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/crime/item/24549-nypd-source-weiner-laptop-has-enough-evidence-to-put-hillary-away-for-life">You can click here to read the truth in The New American magazine.</a></p>
<p>This certainly seems to be an issue that should be resolved before the election.  I guess the media, FBI, and Justice Department don't see it that way.</p>
