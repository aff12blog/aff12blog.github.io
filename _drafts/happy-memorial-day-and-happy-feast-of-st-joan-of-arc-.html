<p style="text-align: left;">Memorial Day is a United States holiday in which we remember the people who died while serving in our country's armed forces. It is also the feast day of St. Joan of Arc which is very fitting since she is the patron saint of soldiers.</p>

<p>St. Joan of Arc was born in 1412 in a small town in France. When Joan was about twelve years old she had a vision of Michael the Archangel. He told her that she was to lead the French in a battle against the English. After she drove the French out she was to take the king to be crowned at Rheims. Joan continued to have visions and hear voices for the next several years. She said they were beautiful and wonderful visions from God. When Joan turned sixteen she decided it was time to listen to her visions and to take action.</p>
<p>Joan met with the king. At first the king was suspicious. While Joan was waiting for the King to make a decision she practiced for battle. She became a proficient fighter and an expert horse rider. The King eventually figured he had nothing to lose. He allowed Joan to accompany a convoy of soldiers and supplies to the city of Orleans that was under siege from the English Army. She was ready when the king said she could fight.</p>
<p>Once in Orleans, she launched an attack against the English. Joan led the attack and was wounded by an arrow during one of the battles. But she didn't stop fighting. She stayed with the troops inspiring them to fight even harder. Joan and the French Army eventually repelled the English troops and caused them to retreat from Orleans. She had won a great victory and saved the French from the English.</p>
