<p>In the early part of the twentieth century, the conspiratorial forces seeking a communist revolution really got moving in the United States.  Mr. Welch quotes Chesterton and the Duke of Northumberland to explain the strategy of changing our republic into a democracy; [But it was a great Englishman, G.K. Chesterton, who put his finger on the basic reasoning behind all the continued and determined efforts of the Communists to convert our republic into a democracy. "You can never have a revolution," he said, "in order to establish a democracy. You must have a democracy in order to have a revolution."  And in 1931 the Duke of Northumberland, in his booklet <em>The History of World Revolution</em>, stated: "The adoption of Democracy as a form of Government by all European nations is fatal to good Government, to liberty, to law and order, to respect for authority, and to religion, and must eventually produce a state of chaos from which a new world tyranny will arise."]</p>
<p>Mr. Welch explains that conspiratorial forces were at work to change the United States into a democracy, as part of a social revolution.  The U.S. had to become a socialist/communist state to fit into the “new world tyranny” referenced by the Duke of Northumberland.</p>
<p>He explains that, “… from the very beginning the whole drive to convert our republic into a democracy was in two parts. One part was to make our people come to believe that we had, and were supposed to have, a democracy. The second part was actually and insidiously to be changing the republic into a democracy”.  The first appreciable and effective progress in both directions began with the election of Woodrow Wilson.    It is hard to tell how much of the tragic disaster of those years was due to the conscious support by Wilson himself of communist purposes, and how much to his being merely a dupe and a tool of Colonel Edward Mandell House. During the Wilson administration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the first time, we see the power of the American presidency being used to support communist schemers and communist schemes in other countries — as especially, for instance, in Mexico, and throughout Latin America.</li>
<li>The first great propaganda slogan was coined and emblazoned everywhere to make Americans start thinking favorably of democracies and forget that we had a republic. This was, of course, the slogan of the first World War: "To make the world safe for democracy."</li>
<li>The direct election of Senators which was the first huge legislative step to break down what the Romans would have called our "mixed constitution" of a republic, and convert it into the homogenous jelly of a democracy.</li>
<li>The progressive income tax.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve</li>
</ol>
<p>Not until Franklin D. Roosevelt came to power in 1933 did the whole Communist-propelled and Communist-managed drive again begin to take visible and tangible and positive steps in their program to make the United States ultimately succumb to a one-world communist tyranny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1928 the <em>U.S. Army Training Manual</em>, used for all of our men in army uniform, gave the following quite accurate definition of a democracy:</p>
<p>A government of the masses. Authority derived through mass meeting or any form of "direct" expression. Results in mobocracy. Attitude toward property is communistic — negating property rights. Attitude toward law is that the will of the majority shall regulate, whether it be based upon deliberation or governed by passion, prejudice, and impulse, without restraint or regard to consequences. Results in demagogism, license, agitation, discontent, anarchy.</p>
<p>But compare that 1928 statement with what was being said in the same place for the same use by 1952. In <em>The Soldiers Guide, Department of the Army Field Manual</em>, issued in June 1952, we find the following:</p>
<p>Meaning of democracy. <em>Because the United States is a democracy</em>, the majority of the people decide how our government will be organized and run — and that includes the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The people do this by electing representatives, and these men and women then carry out the wishes of the people. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Welch observes, “Now obviously this change from basic truth to superficial demagoguery, in the one medium for mass indoctrination of our youth which has been available to the federal government until such time as it achieves control over public education, did not just happen by accident. It was part of an overall design, which became both extensive in its reach and rapid in its execution from 1933 on. Let’s look at another less important but equally striking illustration”.</p>
<p>Former Governor Lehman of New York, in his first inaugural message in 1933, did not once use the word democracy. The poison had not yet reached into the reservoirs from which flowed his political thoughts. In his inaugural message of 1935 he used the word democracy twice. The poison was beginning to work. In his similar message of 1939 he used the word democracy, or a derivative thereof, 25 times. And less than a year later, on January 3, 1940, in his annual message to the New York legislature he used it 33 times. The poison was now permeating every stream of his political philosophy.</p>
