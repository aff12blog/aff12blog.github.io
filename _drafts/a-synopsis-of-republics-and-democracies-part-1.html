<p><strong><em>Robert Welch (1899-1985), founder of the John Birch Society, wrote what is arguably the best description ever of the fundamental differences between a government based upon divine law and one based upon men. His classic "<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/history/item/15370-republics-and-democracies">Republics and Democracies," </a>was first delivered as a speech on September 17 (Constitution Day), 1961.  This is a synopsis of that speech written in the hopes that many more Americans will want to read this important speech, in its entirety.  If most Americans understood the wisdom in this speech, America would be assured of liberty for future generations.</em></strong><!--more--></p>
<p><em><strong>Mr. Welch begins with a look at Greece of 594 BC.</strong> Class strife and turmoil were the order of the day in the city of Athens.  A respected citizen named Solon was asked to solve the many problems within their Democracy.  He gave Athens</em> "the laws of Solon" which were the first written regulations whereby men ever proposed to govern themselves.  Mr. Welch explains that this paved the way for all future republics.  He wrote, “This concept, that there were laws which even kings and dictators must observe, was not only new; I think it can be correctly described as "Western."  While Solon’s laws were in use for about five centuries in Greece, they never achieved a republic.  The idea of rule by law is a foundation principle of a republic but a frame work of representation is also needed.  Without the proper framework the Greek constitution fell into the hands of a succession of tyrants.</p>
<p>Rome of 454 BC adopted a Constitution called the Twelve Tables, based on Solon’s laws.   Before the adoption of <em>The Twelve Tables</em>, Rome had already established the framework, with firm periodicity for its public servants, of a republic in which those laws could be administered.  This framework lasted Rome for about five hundred years.  The Republic of Rome combined a mixed constitution and proper administration by representatives.  Their republic allowed them to avoid hostility between classes and other pitfalls of democracy.  Their elaborate system of checks and balances made an accumulation of power difficult.  It was many centuries before Rome succumbed to tyranny.</p>
<p>In maintaining a Republic, the character of the people is of extreme importance.  Mr. Welch observes the following, [Livy, however, during the days of Augustus, wrote of the virtues that had made Rome great before the Romans had reached the evils of his time, when, as he put it, "We can bear neither our diseases nor their remedies." And those virtues were, he said, "the unity and holiness of family life, the pietas [or reverential attitude] of children, the sacred relation of men with the gods at every step, the sanctity of the solemnly pledged word, the stoic self-control and gravitas [or serious sense of responsibility]." Doesn’t that sound familiar?]</p>
<p>Our founders learned from history.  They gave us a republic and wanted to avoid the evils of democracy.  They knew, from Greek and Roman history, that men become free when subject to the law and in a Republic both people and rulers are subject to the law.  Our founders wanted to bind men down with the chains of a constitution.  They understood that this is how liberty is secured for a moral people.</p>
<p>Mr. Welch explains that, “The word democracy had not occurred in the Declaration of Independence, and does not appear in the constitution of a single one of our fifty states — which constitutions are derived mainly from the thinking of the Founding Fathers of the Republic — for the same reason. They knew all about democracies, and if they had wanted one for themselves and their posterity, they would have founded one. Look at all the elaborate system of checks and balances which they established; at the carefully worked-out protective clauses of the Constitution itself, and especially of the first ten amendments, known as the Bill of Rights; at the effort, as Jefferson put it, to "bind men down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution," and thus to solidify the rule not of men but of laws. All of these steps were taken deliberately to avoid and to prevent a democracy or any of the worst features of a democracy, in the United States of America”.</p>
<p>Mr. Welch quotes extensively from our founders and other respected men throughout history, to show that democracy is evil and we were given a republic because it is much superior to a democracy and any other form of government known to man.  This brief sample is demonstrative, “…Hamilton said: "We are a Republican Government. Real liberty is never found in despotism or in the extremes of Democracy." And Samuel Adams warned: "Remember, Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself! There never was a democracy that ‘did not commit suicide.”</p>
