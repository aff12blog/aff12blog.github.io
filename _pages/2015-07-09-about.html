<p><strong><em>American Family of Faith</em></strong></p>
<p>We are a family of 12. I, Dave AFFleck, and my wife, Debbie, have been married for 25 years (as of February 2015) and are the parents of 10 kids. David (25) is the oldest of the bunch. He graduated from Williamson Free School of Mechanical Trade with an Associate’s degree in Carpentry and currently is an apprentice union carpenter. David and his wife Ashley have two children, Emma (soon to be 2) and Dominic (soon to be 1). Jon (23) graduated this past June from Drexel University with a BS/MS in Mechanical Engineering and works for PECO. Jenny (21) is studying Social Work at Alvernia University and currently works as a nanny. Dan (20) plans to be a computer software developer. Sara (17) will be a Senior at Bishop McDevitt high school and plans to study nursing in college. Matt (16) will be a Junior at McDevitt and is the computer geek of the family. Mary (14) is starting her Freshman year at McDevitt this Fall. Anna (12), Gina (10), and Joey (9) all attend Regina Coeli Academy.</p>
<p>We live on a 3.5 acre property in a big, old farmhouse in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. My parents live in a small house on the property. David and his family live in an apartment on the property, too. We have a pet bunny, Bugs. We also have seven hens that we have raised since they were chicks. This, along with our small garden, is our first small step towards homesteading.</p>
<p>As parents we have striven to instill in our children a strong belief in our Catholic faith and a strong love for America and Americanism.</p>
<p>This blog is truly a family endeavor. I will often post my thoughts on Americanism as embodied in our Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights along with current events. Debbie will be posting on Catholic faith and family matters, recipes and other “mom stuff”. From time to time our children will share what is of interest to them such as, computer/gaming, cooking, sports, or carpentry, etc.</p>
<p>We believe that George Washington was correct in saying “of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.” We believe that the family is the building block of society and we want to model our family as close as possible to the Holy Family…this can be very difficult in our current times.</p>
<p>We believe that the family and the individual along with their property rights and other unalienable rights are gradually becoming extinct. Our Founders would be appalled at the lack of respect for our God-given unalienable rights. Chief among these is the right to life. We hope to be an example of living pro-life, pro-family, and pro-Americanism.</p>
